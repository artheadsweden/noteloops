<p data-pid="p001">By the time I ran out of words the light outside had gone that flat city grey you get just before the street lamps blinked on. My throat felt raw in a way that had nothing to do with shouting into microphones. Keira's notebook looked like it had been through a minor war – pages bent, loops and arrows everywhere, one biro abandoned on the table and another drafted in from her bag as reinforcement.</p>
<p data-pid="p002">The television had moved on. Thatcher's face was gone, replaced first by a cooking show and then by some panel debating rail fares. The caption about thirty-five years since her fall had marched off the edge of the screen. In here, tapes and photographs were spread over the table like we had been planning a heist.</p>
<p data-pid="p003">Keira sat back, stretching her shoulders until they clicked. Her phone lay face down beside the mug she had long since emptied, the screen smeared with thumbprints.</p>
<p data-pid="p004">‘All right,’ she said softly. ‘That was… a lot.’</p>
<p data-pid="p005">‘That is the edited version,’ I said. ‘You should see the director's cut.’</p>
<p data-pid="p006">She snorted, but the laugh broke into something else halfway through. She rubbed the heel of her hand under one eye, quick and annoyed with herself.</p>
<p data-pid="p007">‘Sorry,’ she said. ‘It is just… you talk about it like it is… I do not know. Like it is a gig that overran. 'We opened this place, we did these things, some of us got battered, some of us got arrested, anyway, next track.' Then I look at the dates and it is court cases and people going to prison and—’</p>
<p data-pid="p008">She hesitated, glanced down at Dad's photograph, then back up.</p>
<p data-pid="p009">‘And then I look up what happened after,’ she said, quieter, ‘and your dad is gone and…’</p>
<p data-pid="p010">She trailed off. One of the photographs had ended up near her elbow: Dad outside the pit, hand shading his eyes, colliery headgear behind him. She turned it so it was square in front of her and studied his face like she could read the missing bits.</p>
<p data-pid="p011">‘You have been googling,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p012">‘Obviously,’ she said. ‘I am not a monster.’</p>
<p data-pid="p013">She flipped the phone over and woke it with her thumb. The glare lit her face from below. She slid and tapped, then pushed it across the table so it rested between the tapes.</p>
<p data-pid="p014">On the screen was a grainy still from a VHS transfer: The Furnace stage, cables taped down any old how, banner crooked at the back. A band mid-song. The audio bar along the bottom said GLASS SAINTS – LIVE, 1989 (RARE).</p>
<p data-pid="p015">‘This is you,’ she said. ‘Someone uploaded it five years ago. Two comments. One of them is 'my mum said she met my dad at this gig'.’</p>
<p data-pid="p016">I leaned in. The image was terrible – streaks, static, a faint line along the bottom where the tape had stretched – but it was us. Me with hair and a shirt I would not be caught dead in now. Alex sideways to the mic, mouth open mid-yell. A row of kids at the front, arms up. I could hear the song in my head even before she turned the volume up enough for the tiny speaker to cope.</p>
<p data-pid="p017">It sounded thinner than I remembered, but there it was – Shell's hand-painted banner just visible at the side, COAL NOT DOLE, a white smudge of text in a black rectangle. At the edge of frame, someone's placard jammed between monitor and scaffold pole: THATCHER OUT.</p>
<p data-pid="p018">‘There are a couple of bits on here about The Furnace,’ Keira went on. ‘Blog posts from people who came to gigs, a zine someone has scanned. One of the Poll Tax defence pack leaflets is in an archive in Manchester. There is a quote from Shell in an oral history thing about Orgreave. She is just 'Michelle W., Furnace organiser'.’</p>
<p data-pid="p019">Her finger moved, scrolling. It all looked very clean and small like that, boxed in and sanitised. A line about 'riot footage distributed via activist networks'. A paragraph on the Poll Tax boiled down to two sentences and a footnote.</p>
<p data-pid="p020">‘There is nothing,’ she added, ‘about you lot printing Rupert's briefing papers in the back room and feeding them to the right people at the right time.’</p>
<p data-pid="p021">‘It was more complicated than that,’ I said automatically.</p>
<p data-pid="p022">‘Yeah, but still.’ She looked up at me. ‘You can see the corners where you were, if you know where to look. It is like someone has photoshopped you almost out and left a shadow.’</p>
<p data-pid="p023">I picked up one of the old C90s and turned it over. The screws were faintly rusted, the plastic ridged where the mould had not been perfect. On the label, in my younger self's careful scrawl, I had written GLASS SAINTS – DEMO (PLEASE PLAY).</p>
<p data-pid="p024">‘You are the first person who has ever wanted to look that closely,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p025">‘That cannot be true.’</p>
<p data-pid="p026">‘Journalists do not count,’ I said. ‘Present company excepted, obviously.’</p>
<p data-pid="p027">She made a face, then let it go. When she spoke again her voice had lost the joking edge.</p>
<p data-pid="p028">‘So,’ she said. ‘I have to ask you the thing my tutor will ask me. Was it worth it? All of it. Strike, The Furnace, the coach grids and the Square. Being called the enemy within for half your adult life.’</p>
<p data-pid="p029">There it was. No decorations.</p>
<p data-pid="p030">I sat back. The question had been there all afternoon, crouched behind every memory. In the Square, on the coach grid, in Finchley, in the VHS room, in the court corridors. In Dad's kitchen. In the welfare club when we voted. In the quiet after the march back to work.</p>
<p data-pid="p031">‘Depends what you mean by 'it',’ I said eventually. ‘And what you mean by 'worth'.’</p>
<p data-pid="p032">‘You know what I mean,’ she said. ‘The strike, The Furnace, all of it. You lost your pit anyway. Thatcherism carried on. There was Major, then Blair, then austerity. You moved south and shouted in basements for a decade. Now there is a yoga studio where your venue was and the government are still cutting things. So…’</p>
<p data-pid="p033">She let the end of the sentence hang.</p>
<p data-pid="p034">Out in the street a bus sighed past and the flat settled round it. The little room felt very full.</p>
<p data-pid="p035">‘My dad,’ I said, ‘died with his head up. Not everyone got that. Some lads drank themselves into the ground when the pits shut. Some did not make it past fifty. Dad went out knowing he had fought, and knowing I had not just taken the first job that came along in some warehouse. If we are doing a balance sheet, that goes in the 'worth it' column.’</p>
<p data-pid="p036">I set the tape down and tapped a photograph of the march: a river of bodies, banners held high, faces tiny but fierce.</p>
<p data-pid="p037">‘We learned things,’ I said. ‘How to stand in front of a line of police without flinching. How to organise bail. How to get someone out of a cell at three in the morning without begging. How to make councillors nervous. How to get a bunch of teenagers from three estates to see themselves as allies instead of rivals because there is a bigger enemy over the bridge. You cannot unlearn that. Some of them fought hospital closures. Some fought Clause 28. Some just knew, when their landlord tried to bully them, that they did not have to roll over.’</p>
<p data-pid="p038">Faces came with it. Shell on three phones, eyes red from no sleep. Riz pacing The Furnace foyer with a list of kids who needed safe places and a stack of tokens for the late buses home. Alex arguing with a sound engineer twice his size because the queer support band were getting the same soundcheck we were, or we were not playing.</p>
<p data-pid="p039">‘We kept queer kids alive,’ I said quietly. ‘You do not see that on Radio 4. You do not put it on a graph. But there are people in their fifties now who got through those years because there was somewhere they could go on a Friday night where nobody took the piss out of how they dressed or who they held hands with, and there were posters on the wall about safe sex instead of silence.’</p>
<p data-pid="p040">Keira's pen was idle now. She was just looking at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p041">‘And Thatcher?’ she asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p042">‘A Prime Minister fell,’ I said. ‘And I know, I absolutely know, that part of the reason she fell when she did and how she did is because thousands of people like us shoved from angles that do not show up in tidy narratives. We got people into rooms they were not supposed to be in. We put different pictures in front of people's eyes. We made it harder to pretend none of it was happening.’</p>
<p data-pid="p043">I shrugged.</p>
<p data-pid="p044">‘Can I prove that?’ I said. ‘Can I draw a straight line from a badly recorded gig at The Furnace to some backbench Tory deciding to sign a letter instead of stay loyal? Of course not. History does not work like that. But I can point to five things we did – five fingerprints we left – and I can see where they line up with the cracks. Sometimes that has to be enough.’</p>
<p data-pid="p045">Keira chewed the inside of her cheek. The phone screen had gone dark again; in its blank surface I could see a warped reflection of the tapes between us.</p>
<p data-pid="p046">‘So… yes?’ she said. ‘Worth it?’</p>
<p data-pid="p047">‘Ask me on a bad day and I might say no,’ I said. ‘Ask Shell and you will get a different answer depending on whether she has just come back from a protest or from the doctor. Her daughter Lily runs a housing rights charity in Manchester now – learned the trade young, that one. Her son Lucas teaches carpentry at a community college now, builds sets for the local theatre on weekends. Ask Charlotte and she will tell you she loves this country and hates it in equal measure. Ask Riz and he will say it was worth it if the kids he works with do not have to fight the exact same battles. Ben will tell you it was worth it the first time he realised the kids upstairs knew Shell as something other than a cautionary tale. It is not maths.’</p>
<p data-pid="p048">I poured the dregs from the pot into my mug. It came out dark and strong.</p>
<p data-pid="p049">‘Today,’ I said, ‘sitting here with my knees complaining and my old life on the table and the telly saying it was all demographics and Europe, I would say yes. It was worth it. Not because it fixed everything. Because we chose not to sit still.’</p>
<p data-pid="p050">For a moment there was nothing but the faint rush of traffic outside and the ticking of the cheap wall clock.</p>
<p data-pid="p051">Then Keira leaned forward and flicked one of the tapes with her fingernail.</p>
<p data-pid="p052">‘So what happens to these?’ she said. ‘Because if you die and your landlord gets a clearance company in, this lot is gone. Then all the men in suits are left alone with the story.’</p>
<p data-pid="p053">‘Cheery,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p054">‘I am serious,’ she said. ‘This is primary source material. You have got VHS of court days, for God's sake. You cannot just leave it in a cardboard box.’</p>
<p data-pid="p055">‘I do not keep them under the bed,’ I said. ‘I am not a monster either.’</p>
<p data-pid="p056">She rolled her eyes, then rummaged in her bag.</p>
<p data-pid="p057">‘Our library have got a digitisation project,’ she said. ‘Oral histories, community archives, that kind of thing. There will be a queue, but if I tell my supervisor I have got a living, breathing ex–enemy within with tapes in his front room, they will bite my hand off. We could get them cleaned up. Upload the bits people can see. Put the rest somewhere safe. Get the Poll Tax defence pack into a catalogue instead of a cardboard box.’</p>
<p data-pid="p058">‘We?’</p>
<p data-pid="p059">‘You do not get to complain about how they tell your story on telly and then leave your version in a cardboard box,’ she said. ‘That is not allowed. There is probably a clause about it in the journalist's handbook.’</p>
<p data-pid="p060">I thought of strangers listening to Shell's voice, seeing Dad's face on some archive website. Of academics picking over flyers and setlists. The idea made me itch. It also loosened a small, unexpected knot in my chest.</p>
<p data-pid="p061">‘All right,’ I said slowly. ‘We can… look into it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p062">‘'Look into it',’ she repeated with deep scepticism. ‘Classic old man answer.’</p>
<p data-pid="p063">‘Watch it,’ I said. ‘I know where you live.’</p>
<p data-pid="p064">‘Upstairs from you,’ she said. ‘Where the Wi-Fi actually reaches the bedroom.’</p>
<p data-pid="p065">She grinned, but there was something fierce underneath.</p>
<p data-pid="p066">‘We will start with three tapes,’ she said. ‘One gig, one meeting, one of the Square. I will bring the uni recorder next week. You can sit here making tea and tutting while we capture them. Then we will see who wants them.’</p>
<p data-pid="p067">I could picture it: the whirr of the machine, the blue bar crawling across a screen, Shell's voice moving from magnetic tape to however many servers you need now. The thought made me oddly tired and oddly hopeful.</p>
<p data-pid="p068">‘You realise,’ I said, ‘that means other people will get to argue about whether it was worth it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p069">‘Good,’ she said. ‘That is the point, is it not? You lot did not do all this so nobody would talk about it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p070">She looked down at Dad's photograph again, then back up.</p>
<p data-pid="p071">‘Will you take me?’ she asked suddenly.</p>
<p data-pid="p072">‘Where?’</p>
<p data-pid="p073">‘Grimethorpe,’ she said. ‘The pit. Or what is left of it. For the ending of the piece. 'Our correspondent travels north with her source to see where it all began.'’ She pulled a mock-serious face. ‘We can stand in a business park car park and you can point at a B&amp;M Bargains and say 'This used to be a way of life.' And maybe I can meet Shell properly somewhere that is not a crackly VHS tape.’</p>
<p data-pid="p074">‘Might be a Tesco,’ I said. ‘Do not libel B&amp;M.’</p>
<p data-pid="p075">‘Whatever,’ she said. ‘You know what I mean.’</p>
<p data-pid="p076">I thought of the last time I had been back. Estates thinning out. Pit lane blocked, headgear gone, new houses and an office block where the winding gear had been. The little memorial garden with plaques. Dad stamping his feet in the cold outside the gates, snow catching in his hair.</p>
<p data-pid="p077">‘Yeah,’ I said. ‘All right. We can go.’</p>
<p data-pid="p078">She shut her notebook with a soft slap.</p>
<p data-pid="p079">‘Deal,’ she said. ‘In return, I will not quote you directly calling yourself 'the enemy within' unless you want me to.’</p>
<p data-pid="p080">‘Oh, leave it in,’ I said. ‘We earned it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p081">She laughed, and the weight in the room shifted a fraction. She gathered her pens back into their case and stood, stretching until her back clicked again.</p>
<p data-pid="p082">‘Right,’ she said. ‘I am going to write this before my brain loses it. Text me when you have checked your calendar for a Grimethorpe field trip.’</p>
<p data-pid="p083">‘You think I need a calendar these days?’ I said. ‘My social life is appointment letters and two-for-one cinema vouchers.’</p>
<p data-pid="p084">‘Then it will not be hard to find a free day, will it?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p085">At the door she hesitated, hand on the frame much as she had that morning.</p>
<p data-pid="p086">‘Danny?’</p>
<p data-pid="p087">‘Mm?’</p>
<p data-pid="p088">‘Thanks,’ she said. ‘For… you know. Letting me in.’</p>
<p data-pid="p089">‘You lot opened the door,’ I said. ‘We just kept jamming it with bits of wood. This is your story now as much as mine.’</p>
<p data-pid="p090">She rolled her eyes at the sentiment, but she was smiling when she went.</p>
<p data-pid="p091">*</p>
<p data-pid="p092">We went north a fortnight later, after I had rung Shell and Ben and promised to stop pretending I would sort the tapes ‘one day’. Shell said she would get Lily to bully a friendly archivist in Manchester into sending links to forms. Ben, in his steady way, just said ‘About time’.</p>
<p data-pid="p093">The train out of King’s Cross was full of people heading for meetings and family visits and football matches. Keira kept up a steady commentary about the snacks trolley and the price of tea, fingers flying over her laptop keys in between. Every so often she glanced up to ask something – a name, a date, the layout of The Furnace – then dived back into whatever she was writing.</p>
<p data-pid="p094">The closer we got, the more the view shifted from terraces and light industrial units to fields and the ghosts of old workings. You cannot always see where a pit was if you do not know how to read the land, but once someone has pointed it out, you start spotting the scars – an odd rise where there should not be one, a stand of trees planted to cover something, a road that kinks for no obvious reason.</p>
<p data-pid="p095">At Doncaster we followed the signs out to the bus stand for the last leg. Grimethorpe was only a name on a board to most of the people milling around, but the word still did something to me.</p>
<p data-pid="p096">As the bus rolled past the welfare building – still standing, miraculously, though the windows were new and the sign said COMMUNITY CENTRE now – I could hear brass drifting faintly from inside. Sunday morning rehearsal.</p>
<p data-pid="p097">‘The Grimethorpe Colliery Band,’ I said to Keira. ‘Still going. They outlasted the pit by forty years and counting.’</p>
<p data-pid="p098">She tilted her head, listening. The sound was muffled but unmistakable – cornets warming up, someone running scales on euphonium.</p>
<p data-pid="p099">‘I thought…’ she began.</p>
<p data-pid="p100">‘Everyone does,’ I said. ‘But they kept at it. Competitions, recordings, tours. Still one of the best in the country. You can close a pit but you cannot silence brass if the players refuse to put their instruments down.’</p>
<p data-pid="p101">Grimethorpe itself was both familiar and not. The high street had different shopfronts, the pub names had changed, but the slope of the road and the wind that came down it were exactly the same. There was a café now where the old hardware shop had been – Libbi's, all exposed brick and flat whites, the kind of place that would have been science fiction in 1984. The library had been rebuilt with lottery money, bright and clean with a children's section that looked like someone had actually thought about it. A flower shop occupied what used to be Mrs Kaur's front room, baskets hanging outside, pastel paint on the door.</p>
<p data-pid="p102">The village had been scrubbed, renovated, made fit for commuters and young families priced out of Barnsley. But walk three streets over and you could still see the other Grimethorpe: boarded-up fronts, lads on corners with nowt to do, houses where nobody had had a steady job since the pit closed. The investment had been real – a hundred million quid between 1996 and 2008, five hundred new homes on the edges of the village – but it had not reached everywhere.</p>
<p data-pid="p103">We walked past the estate where we had lived, past the bus stop where I had waited with my guitar case, to the lane that used to run to the pit.</p>
<p data-pid="p104">There was a metal barrier across it now, the kind you see in trading estates. Beyond, a neat sign with a logo announced GRIMETHORPE BUSINESS PARK. The only coal was a memory in cracks in the tarmac.</p>
<p data-pid="p105">‘God,’ Keira said softly.</p>
<p data-pid="p106">‘You were expecting a shaft straight to Hell?’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p107">‘Kind of,’ she admitted. ‘This is… I do not know. Worse.’</p>
<p data-pid="p108">The ASOS distribution center dominated the site, a vast shed of corrugated metal and glass where the winding gear used to be. You could see it from the motorway – massive, clean-edged, the kind of building that could have been anywhere. Thousands worked there now, more than the pit ever employed at its peak, but it was warehouse work: picking and packing, scanning barcodes, moving boxes on conveyor belts. Not the same, everyone said. Steady money, though, which was more than some places had.</p>
<p data-pid="p109">We ducked round the barrier like we were not supposed to, just for old time's sake. The air smelled of nothing much: wet concrete, distant takeaway, the faint tang of a diesel engine. Past the ASOS gates there were smaller units with shutters, a gym with posters of people lifting weights, a car valeting place. The memorial garden sat in one corner, a neat rectangle of grass and stone with a metal bench.</p>
<p data-pid="p110">I had brought two things in my bag. One was the tally disc Dad had pressed into my hand the night before I first went to London, during the strike – a reminder of what we were fighting for, and who was paying the price. The other was a Coalface tape, one of the ones we had run off in someone's bedroom in 1984 with the levels all wrong and the backing vocals too loud – the same set we had played at the 100 Club, the night that kept coming back every time I thought about where the noise had started.</p>
<p data-pid="p111">At the edge of the garden there was a little bed of gravel with a few larger stones arranged in it. I knelt, my knees protesting, and laid the tally disc there among them. Next to it I set the tape, label down so the plastic caught the pale winter light.</p>
<p data-pid="p112">‘Is that… allowed?’ Keira asked quietly.</p>
<p data-pid="p113">‘There are no rules,’ I said. ‘We used to be quite good at ignoring them.’</p>
<p data-pid="p114">We sat on the bench. The wind tugged at her hair and at my scarf. For a while neither of us said anything. There did not seem much point.</p>
<p data-pid="p115">‘You know,’ she said eventually, ‘when we get back, the programme will be online. The one with the tidy-haired professor.’</p>
<p data-pid="p116">‘Of course it will,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p117">‘They will still be talking about internal party dynamics,’ she said. ‘Still saying 'significant but not decisive'.’</p>
<p data-pid="p118">‘That is their job,’ I said. ‘Cannot have them admitting a bunch of kids with C90s helped. It would ruin the mystique.’</p>
<p data-pid="p119">She turned to look at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p120">‘You going to watch it?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p121">‘Maybe,’ I said. ‘After we have had a proper tea. And after I have finished labelling boxes so nobody can say it all vanished because we forgot to write our names on the spine.’</p>
<p data-pid="p122">She smiled, then sobered.</p>
<p data-pid="p123">‘When I write this,’ she said, ‘I am not going to be able to prove any of it either. Not the way they like. I will have your tapes and your memories and a couple of footnotes. There will be people who say I am romanticising it. Or making it up.’</p>
<p data-pid="p124">‘Let them,’ I said. ‘They called us liars at the time. 'Rent-a-mob'. 'Enemies of democracy'. You get used to it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p125">She leaned back, hands deep in her coat pockets, eyes on the little patch of ground where the pit had been.</p>
<p data-pid="p126">‘What will you call it?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p127">‘The piece?’ she said. ‘No idea. Probably something boring my editor insists on, like 'Voices from The Furnace' or 'Memories of the Enemy Within'. He will want her name in the title for search engines.’</p>
<p data-pid="p128">‘Of course he will,’ I said. ‘Tell him to call it 'Significant but not decisive'.’</p>
<p data-pid="p129">She laughed, then shivered.</p>
<p data-pid="p130">‘Come on,’ she said. ‘Let us find somewhere that still does a decent pie and chips. You can show me where your band first murdered a Buzzcocks cover.’</p>
<p data-pid="p131">We walked back towards the main road, past the sign for the business park, past the bus stop. In the gravel bed where I had left them, the tape and the tally disc sat side by side, two small, stubborn objects in a landscaped corner of what used to be a way of life.</p>
<p data-pid="p132">*</p>
<p data-pid="p133">If you take the bus out of Grimethorpe now and stay on until the stop near the old estate where we used to live, you can walk up a side street that kinks for no good reason and find a neat semi with a square of gravel where the front garden ought to be. There is a hand-painted sign in the window – MEETING TONIGHT, 7PM, COMMUNITY HALL – and another, smaller one taped to the glass at eye height that says NO TRANSPHOBIA, NO RACISM, NO TORIES.</p>
<p data-pid="p134">That is Shell and Ben's place.</p>
<p data-pid="p135">We did not go there straight away. The first time I took Keira up, we did the official things: pit, memorial, pub, the lane where I used to wait for the bus with a guitar case and a head full of noise. Only after that did we walk up to the house where the curtains never quite shut properly because there is always someone looking out for who has turned up.</p>
<p data-pid="p136">Ben opened the door, wiping his hands on a tea towel. He has gone grey at the temples, the way some men do that makes them look more solid, not less. He gave me the kind of hug that lifts you slightly off your feet and knocks the air out of you.</p>
<p data-pid="p137">‘All right, old man,’ he said into my shoulder. ‘You took your time.’</p>
<p data-pid="p138">‘Busy schedule,’ I said. ‘You know how it is.’</p>
<p data-pid="p139">He let go and turned to Keira.</p>
<p data-pid="p140">‘You must be Keira,’ he said. ‘She has told us about you.’</p>
<p data-pid="p141">‘Kitchen's this way,’ he said. ‘If we stand in the hall Shell will start fretting about draughts.’</p>
<p data-pid="p142">The house smelled of curry and printer ink and the faint metallic tang of the radiators trying their best. Every surface seemed to be doing two jobs at once. The kitchen table was half-cleared from someone's late lunch and half-covered in flyers for a tenants' meeting. On the fridge were photographs of kids and grandkids and other people's kids, held up with magnets from trade union conferences. A notebook lay open by the kettle with a list that read CALL COUNCIL – MARY / PRINTER / LILY – ZOOM / BEN – HALL KEYS.</p>
<p data-pid="p143">Shell was at the sink, sleeves rolled up, rinsing mugs. She had her reading glasses pushed up into her hair and a pen behind one ear. When she turned and saw me she did not fuss, just wiped her hands and came at me with a fierce, economical hug that said more than any speech.</p>
<p data-pid="p144">‘You look knackered,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p145">‘Likewise,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p146">‘Do not start,’ she said. ‘We are officially retired, remember?’ She made the word sound like a private joke. ‘This must be Keira.’</p>
<p data-pid="p147">Keira stuck her hand out, then seemed to think better of it and went for a half-hug instead. Shell accommodated both without missing a beat.</p>
<p data-pid="p148">‘Thank you for looking after this daft sod's tapes,’ Shell said.</p>
<p data-pid="p149">‘He is looking after them,’ Keira said. ‘I am just trying to bully him into sharing.’</p>
<p data-pid="p150">‘Good,’ Shell said. ‘We spent long enough bullying him into getting them out of cardboard boxes.’</p>
<p data-pid="p151">We sat at the table. Ben made tea the proper Yorkshire way, strong enough to stand a spoon in, and put a plate of biscuits in the middle that he pretended were for us but demolished a good third of himself. From the front room came the sound of the six o'clock news turned down low.</p>
<p data-pid="p152">‘Lily would have loved to be here,’ Shell said, pouring. ‘She is stuck in Manchester fighting some bastard housing association who think fire regulations are optional. She says hello and that if you misquote her in your article she will set her volunteers on you.’</p>
<p data-pid="p153">‘Duly noted,’ Keira said, scribbling.</p>
<p data-pid="p154">‘Charlotte is in London this week,’ Shell went on. ‘Some photo thing with refugees. She sent a text this morning: 'Tell the journalist I am not dead, just knackered.' That is her review of the last forty years.’</p>
<p data-pid="p155">She said it lightly, but there was a fondness in it that sat somewhere between pride and exasperation.</p>
<p data-pid="p156">‘Everyone ended up where they were always going,’ I said. ‘Just with more bruises.’</p>
<p data-pid="p157">‘You included,’ Ben said. ‘Mister 'I will just go down for a bit and play some gigs', now with a living-room archive and a student journalist on retainer.’</p>
<p data-pid="p158">Keira looked from one to the other.</p>
<p data-pid="p159">‘You two have been doing this a long time,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p160">‘We have been arguing a long time,’ Shell said. ‘Everything else is decoration.’</p>
<p data-pid="p161">She reached across and squeezed Ben's wrist without looking at him. It was such an unshowy, ordinary gesture that it said more about them than any grand declaration could have. All those years of separate lives – him above the venue with the kids, her holding everything else together – had settled into this: two people in a small kitchen in Grimethorpe, joint owners of a kettle and a stack of minutes from the last tenants' association meeting.</p>
<p data-pid="p162">‘For the record,’ I said to Keira, ‘in case your editor gets ideas: there was never anything like this between me and Shell.’</p>
<p data-pid="p163">Shell snorted.</p>
<p data-pid="p164">‘God, no,’ she said. ‘Love him to bits, would kill for him, have occasionally wanted to kill him. But not like that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p165">‘Thank you,’ I said. ‘Glad we have that on tape.’</p>
<p data-pid="p166">‘Somebody has to squash the myths before they start,’ she said. ‘They will make us all sleep together if you let them.’</p>
<p data-pid="p167">Ben grinned.</p>
<p data-pid="p168">‘I got the good end of the deal,’ he said. ‘I got Shell and I did not have to pretend to like his guitar solos.’</p>
<p data-pid="p169">‘Rude,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p170">Keira's pen scratched. Outside, a car went past somewhere, tyres hissing on damp tarmac.</p>
<p data-pid="p171">‘So,’ Shell said, turning back to Keira. ‘What do you want from us, then? Apart from tea and free quotes.’</p>
<p data-pid="p172">‘I want to see how it lands,’ Keira said. ‘All the stuff he has been talking about. The Square, the tapes, Finchley. What it looks like from here now.’</p>
<p data-pid="p173">‘It lands like the gas bill,’ Shell said. ‘You still have to pay it, even if you were right at the time.’ She smiled, softer. ‘But also… Lily says the kids who come into the advice centre now are not starting from scratch. They have heard of Clause 28, even if they were not born then. They know landlords can be challenged. They come in already angry instead of ashamed. So maybe some of it stuck.’</p>
<p data-pid="p174">Ben nodded.</p>
<p data-pid="p175">‘There are lads on this estate,’ he said, ‘who come round here with their mates and borrow books about the strike and the Poll Tax and Black Lives Matter and all sorts. They stand in this kitchen and tell Shell what they are organising on TikTok. That is your answer, is it not? If they have got more tools than we did, then it was worth getting our heads kicked in.’</p>
<p data-pid="p176">Keira looked at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p177">‘Significant but not decisive,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p178">‘Story of my life,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p179">We stayed until it was properly dark, listening to them bicker about who had first suggested what in 1988 and whether it had been my idea to put Rupert's draft on that particular desk. At some point Lily rang from a train and shouted down the line about a landlord who had tried to evict a whole stairwell and failed. Charlotte sent a picture of a rain-slicked protest somewhere in central London with the caption STILL HERE in capital letters. The past and the present sat down together at Shell and Ben's table and helped themselves to biscuits.</p>
<p data-pid="p180">On the way back to the station Keira walked a few paces ahead, coat pulled tight, eyes moving from the business park sign to the boarded-up shops to the terrace where we had lived.</p>
<p data-pid="p181">‘It is going to sound made up,’ she said eventually. ‘All of it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p182">‘Good,’ I said. ‘If it sounded tidy it would be a lie.’</p>
<p data-pid="p183">She nodded, more to herself than to me.</p>
<p data-pid="p184">‘Noise, base, movement, access, disruption,’ she said under her breath, as if testing how the words fitted together. ‘Five fingerprints.’</p>
<p data-pid="p185">‘Write them down before you forget,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p186">‘Already have,’ she said, patting her bag. ‘Twice.’</p>
<p data-pid="p187">Later, back in London, there would be laptops and digitising rigs and university forms. There would be arguments with archivists about context and consent. There would be emails from people who found their younger selves on a grainy video and wanted to tell me where they had ended up. There would be nights when I sat in this same flat listening to Shell's voice come out of headphones through twenty-first-century speakers, as sharp as the day we recorded her, and messages from Lily and Charlotte and kids whose names I did not yet know telling me what they were building now.</p>
<p data-pid="p188">And somewhere – Grimethorpe, Glasgow, a housing estate further south – there would be a lad or a lass scrolling past an old clip of a band in a hall and a crowd chanting, thinking: if they could do that then, what can we do now?</p>
<p data-pid="p189">They called us the enemy within. Fair enough. We were. We learned to walk through side doors – through gigs and posh kids and one nervous Tory with a conscience. We threaded ourselves through gaps, left tapes in glove compartments and dossiers on desks and footprints in places no one expected us. Noise, base, movement, access, disruption: five fingerprints on a story they still keep trying to file down. Maybe that is all history is in the end: a thousand small acts that no one can prove added up to a fall.</p>
<p data-pid="p190">This is just my page of it.</p>
<p data-pid="p191">*</p>
<p data-pid="p192">Keira asked me, later, what we were doing now. Not the big, abstract we – History, the Movement, the enemy within – but the lot of us as people. Where all that energy went when the pits were shut and the coaches stopped running and you could not keep living like every week might be the week you toppled someone.</p>
<p data-pid="p193">The boring answer is: it went into work and rent and knees that do not like cold mornings. It went into kids and grandkids and caring for people who could not care for themselves any more. It went into paperwork. It went into arguing with councils about damp and arguing with doctors about waiting lists and arguing with employers about shifts.</p>
<p data-pid="p194">The real answer is: it never went away. It just changed its clothes.</p>
<p data-pid="p195">Me, I still play. Not Coalface – that band belongs to a particular set of years, a particular kind of anger – but I never learned how to stop needing a room and a rhythm and a chorus you can shout without thinking. These days it is a ska band called Beat Assembly. We play when we can, for whoever turns up, and the strange miracle of it is that you can find us on Spotify and the other platforms like we have always been there. Same impulse, different tempo.</p>
<p data-pid="p196">Shell is still Shell. Even when she says she is retired there is a notebook open somewhere, there are flyers in a neat stack, there is someone being gently but firmly bullied into showing up. Ben keeps the kettle going, keeps the doors open, keeps noticing the kids who hover on the edge of things and making it clear they are allowed in.</p>
<p data-pid="p197">Riz still does the work that never gets put on the timeline. He finds a way to get a teenager through a bad week. He knows which forms to tick, which doors to knock, which lies to call out. When he says "worth it", he is not talking about Thatcher. He is talking about survival.</p>
<p data-pid="p198">Charlotte never stopped moving either. She is still in London more often than not, still turning up where the story is and pointing her camera at the bit everyone else would rather crop out. She sends the same kind of messages she always did – blunt, funny, half a swear word and half a blessing – and every so often, when the weather is foul and the world feels like it is going backwards, a picture lands in the group chat: rain on a banner, police lights, faces turned to the wind. STILL HERE.</p>
<p data-pid="p199">Alex and Pete turned the skills we learned into different kinds of craft. They are still fussy about soundchecks. They still care about who gets heard. If you need a room rigged, a tape rescued, a story copied before it disappears, they are the ones who show up with the right cable and the right stubbornness.</p>
<p data-pid="p200">And my mam – Victoria Ashcroft, who used to apologise for taking up space in her own kitchen – never went back to what she had been before the strike. None of the women did. You cannot spend a year feeding whole villages, running rotas, facing police lines, speaking in rooms full of men who have never had to listen to you, and then quietly fold yourself up again when the men go back to work. The pits shut and the old world tried to set itself back in place, but the shape had changed. The women had changed it. They did not hand that power back.</p>
<p data-pid="p201">That is the bit people still miss when they want a tidy ending. They want to believe everything went back to normal once the strike was over. It did not. Not for the men. Not for the women. Not for any of us.</p></div>
