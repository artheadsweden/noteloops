<p data-pid="p001">The day of Live Aid did not start with the telly. It started with Shell in the doorway of our room in the house just after ten, canvas bag on her shoulder, face that had done four hours on a train and thirty years in a mining village. She was back for a few days, making the rounds between Yorkshire and London like she had promised.</p>
<p data-pid="p002">‘You look knackered,’ I said, taking the bag from her.</p>
<p data-pid="p003">‘Thanks, love,’ she said. ‘Good to see you too.’</p>
<p data-pid="p004">She hugged me hard enough to hurt, then stepped back and looked round the room. Same stack of tapes, same mattress on the floor, but now there was a door you could close and a partition that almost counted as privacy. New poster for a band she had never heard of.</p>
<p data-pid="p005">‘You have not got any tidier,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p006">‘It is an aesthetic,’ Alex called from the kitchenette. ‘Controlled chaos.’</p>
<p data-pid="p007">He stuck his head round the partition, hair tied back, frying pan in hand.</p>
<p data-pid="p008">‘Tea?’ he said. ‘I have gone all out. There is bread.’</p>
<p data-pid="p009">‘Posh,’ Shell said, dropping onto the edge of the mattress. ‘I remember when you two were living on crisps and other people's leftovers.’</p>
<p data-pid="p010">‘I still am,’ I said. ‘He has moved up in the world. Got a bar job. Sometimes he brings back actual food.’</p>
<p data-pid="p011">‘It is not a bar job,’ Alex said. ‘It is curating beverages. Get it right.’</p>
<p data-pid="p012">Shell laughed, then caught sight of the telly in the corner, perched on a crate with a bit of cloth thrown over it to hide the worst of the splinters. On screen, a presenter in too much make-up stood in an empty Wembley, talking about history while crew in high-vis jackets hurried around behind her.</p>
<p data-pid="p013">‘They have been on about it all week,’ Shell said. ‘Kids had a map at school. Teacher kept going on about how we are all part of it. Half of them have not got shoes that fit, but we are all part of it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p014">She said it lightly, but there was a strain round her mouth I recognised from the kitchen at home. If you pushed, something would spill that neither of you wanted to mop up in front of other people.</p>
<p data-pid="p015">‘You still glad you came?’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p016">‘Ask me after Queen,’ she said. ‘Eddie wanted me to shout myself hoarse to 'We Are the Champions' on his behalf. We are still married, still mates, still co-parents. Just not... the other bit any more.’</p>
<p data-pid="p017">She said it matter-of-factly, like reporting the weather.</p>
<p data-pid="p018">‘We can manage the shouting,’ Alex said. ‘I have been practising my stadium arms.’</p>
<p data-pid="p019">He lifted his hands above his head in a slow wave, nearly knocking a mug off the counter. Shell shook her head, but she was smiling now.</p>
<p data-pid="p020">Riz waved at us from the kitchenette doorway with a bundle of flyers tucked under his arm, muttering that he'd rather get them dropped off at the solidarity centre before the telly swallowed the whole city.</p>
<p data-pid="p021">*</p>
<p data-pid="p022">We headed into town just before midday, the three of us squeezed along a Victoria line carriage with half of London. Band Aid T-shirts, homemade badges, kids clutching cardboard guitars, women with prams wedged into the doorways. Snatches of “Do They Know It Is Christmas?” leaked from a tinny cassette player every time the train lurched.</p>
<p data-pid="p023">Shell stood with one hand on the rail above, the other curled round her bag strap. Her NUM badge was pinned to her denim jacket, the red and gold dulled by a year of marches and weather. Under it she had clipped a small enamel Africa outline someone had given her at a solidarity meeting. Two worlds on one lapel.</p>
<p data-pid="p024">‘How are things at home?’ I asked, not quite looking at her.</p>
<p data-pid="p025">‘Quiet,’ she said. ‘Too quiet, some days. Then the telly is loud and Eddie is loud and Lily is loud and I would kill for half an hour of quiet. Make of that what you will.’</p>
<p data-pid="p026">‘He all right about you coming down?’</p>
<p data-pid="p027">‘He said, 'What is London going to do for our gas bill?'’ she said. ‘Then he put a tenner on the table and said if you are going, you are not going without money. So yes and no.’</p>
<p data-pid="p028">She looked at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p029">‘He is scared,’ she said. ‘We all are. Strike is over, pits are still closing, nobody knows what is coming. This’ – she nodded at a Tube advert with the Live Aid logo on it – ‘this is something that is not about us losing for once. Even if it is daft, I wanted to see it with you.’</p>
<p data-pid="p030">My throat tightened.</p>
<p data-pid="p031">‘We are not done,’ I said. ‘Not with this. Not with anything.’</p>
<p data-pid="p032">‘I know,’ she said. ‘That is why I am here.’</p>
<p data-pid="p033">*</p>
<p data-pid="p034">The Soho pub was already heaving when we pushed the door open, heat slapping us in the face. Someone had dragged a big colour telly onto a shelf above the bar, screen tilted down over the crowd like a blessed object. The landlord had taped a hand-written sign underneath: NO FOOTBALL TODAY. FEED THE WORLD INSTEAD.</p>
<p data-pid="p035">Alex fought his way to the bar, doing that London thing of muttering sorry without sounding sorry. Shell and I wedged ourselves against a wall under a framed photo of some forgotten crooner. The air smelled of beer, fried onions from the street, perfume and cigarette smoke.</p>
<p data-pid="p036">Alex came back with two pints and a ginger beer and handed the soft drink to Shell without comment, like it was the most normal thing in the world. She'd been on the soft stuff since she'd found out she was pregnant. She raised the bottle in a small salute, jaw tight for a heartbeat, then let it go.</p>
<p data-pid="p037">On the screen, Status Quo bounced, denim flashing. The whole pub joined in with “Rockin All Over the World”, pints slopping, elbows knocking ribs. Shell rolled her eyes and sang anyway.</p>
<p data-pid="p038">‘Thought you hated this lot,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p039">‘Course I do,’ she shouted back. ‘That is not the point.’</p>
<p data-pid="p040">She threw an arm round my shoulders for the chorus. For a second I was twelve again, Mam's records on the Dansette, one of my brothers dancing in his socks.</p>
<p data-pid="p041">When the camera cut to the BBC commentator, smiling too hard with Wembley yawning behind him, the volume in the pub dipped. He talked about a global jukebox, about the world joining hands through music. They threw to the studio, where a man in a suit said something about ordinary people making a difference.</p>
<p data-pid="p042">‘Where were they in March?’ a bloke near us said, voice flat. ‘Where were they when we were rattling tins in Barnsley high street?’</p>
<p data-pid="p043">His friend shushed him, glancing at the bar, but Shell nodded once, sharp.</p>
<p data-pid="p044">Near the back, where the light from the doorway still reached, a little group had set up a folding card table with leaflets and a bucket on it. ETHIOPIA SOLIDARITY – LOCAL GROUP, the hand-painted sign said. A woman with short hair and a knitted waistcoat was talking intently to a couple clutching lagers.</p>
<p data-pid="p045">‘It is not just famine,’ she was saying. ‘It is debt, it is trade, it is what our government does with their government. If we do not talk about that, we will be doing this again in ten years.’</p>
<p data-pid="p046">I saw Shell watching her.</p>
<p data-pid="p047">‘Friend of yours?’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p048">‘Met her at a solidarity night back in winter,’ Shell said. ‘She came up to Barnsley with leaflets after. Knows more about the World Bank than half the blokes in Westminster.’</p>
<p data-pid="p049">‘You two should swap files,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p050">‘We did,’ Shell said. ‘She has got the pensions stuff, I have got the eviction cases.’</p>
<p data-pid="p051">She said it with the same pride other people used when they talked about record collections.</p>
<p data-pid="p052">‘Danny.’</p>
<p data-pid="p053">Charlotte was a few feet away, coat already off, dark hair clipped back from her face. White shirt with the sleeves rolled, black trousers, boots that had never seen pit sludge but looked sturdy enough. A camera hung from her neck, silver catching the low light.</p>
<p data-pid="p054">'You made it,' I said, suddenly breathless.</p>
<p data-pid="p055">'Would not miss it,' she said. 'If the end of the world is being televised, I would like a decent view.'</p>
<p data-pid="p056">She stepped in and brushed her cheek against mine, London fashion. My skin prickled.</p>
<p data-pid="p057">'Charlotte,' I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p058">'The one with the posh coat,' Charlotte said, offering her hand again. 'London owes you a lot of casseroles.'</p>
<p data-pid="p059">Shell took it without hesitation.</p>
<p data-pid="p060">Shell snorted.</p>
<p data-pid="p061">‘London can keep its casseroles,’ she said. ‘Tell it to send us its lawyers.’</p>
<p data-pid="p062">‘Working on it,’ Charlotte said. ‘I brought some journalists, will that do for today?’</p>
<p data-pid="p063">Behind her were two blokes and another woman, all too well dressed for the place, collars neat, hair cut sharp. One of the men was already scanning the room like it was layout for a feature.</p>
<p data-pid="p064">‘Friends from college,’ Charlotte said quietly. ‘They write things people who like to feel informed read. That all right?’</p>
<p data-pid="p065">‘Depends what they write,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p066">‘Ask me again later,’ she said, and smiled.</p>
<p data-pid="p067">*</p>
<p data-pid="p068">The day unfolded in waves. Bands I had never cared about suddenly had the whole pub swaying. Women cried at songs they had danced to in discos without thinking about starving children. Men who had called us layabouts six months earlier stuffed notes into the Ethiopia bucket and declared that something must be done.</p>
<p data-pid="p069">Shell sat through one glossy American act with her jaw clenched.</p>
<p data-pid="p070">‘They are using it, love,’ she said in my ear. ‘Every one of them. For what, I do not know. Record sales. Image. Maybe some of them mean it. I cannot tell.’</p>
<p data-pid="p071">‘Does it matter if the money gets there?’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p072">She thought about it.</p>
<p data-pid="p073">‘Matters if people think that is all it takes,’ she said. ‘A song and a cheque and you are absolved.’</p>
<p data-pid="p074">When Queen came on, the room changed shape. People surged closer, the landlord turned the volume up so far the speakers crackled. Freddie Mercury strutted across the stage like he had invented stadiums, white vest bright as a flare. The call and response rolled across Wembley and into Soho; the crowd in the pub answered back as if he could hear them. Ay-oh. Ay-oh.</p>
<p data-pid="p075">I looked at the screen and saw one man with a piano making seventy thousand people move like he was pulling a string. It was beautiful and infuriating. All that power, no picket line in sight.</p>
<p data-pid="p076">‘Imagine if we had had that for the strike,’ Alex said into my ear. ‘She would have had to nationalise us out of sheer embarrassment.’</p>
<p data-pid="p077">‘She would have called it the Enemy Within Telethon,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p078">Shell laughed once, then pressed her fingers hard into her eyes.</p>
<p data-pid="p079">‘You all right?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p080">‘I am fine,’ she said thickly. ‘Just thinking of kids at home who went to bed hungry while this lot were booking hotels.’</p>
<p data-pid="p081">*</p>
<p data-pid="p082">Later, after yet another earnest studio speech, the air got too thick. Charlotte caught my sleeve.</p>
<p data-pid="p083">'Still not smoking? Care to join me for some air anyway?' she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p084">'Fresh air sounds good,' I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p085">She was already pushing towards the door.</p>
<p data-pid="p086">Outside, the street felt like something had washed over it and left a film. Live Aid leaked from every open window and doorway, the same commentary in different throats. Cars crawled past with radios up. A couple of lads sold knock-off T-shirts out of a bin liner.</p>
<p data-pid="p087">We stood under the pub sign, metal creaking whenever the alley breathed. Charlotte lit a cigarette, cupping her hand round the match.</p>
<p data-pid="p088">‘You really do not smoke?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p089">‘Dad would have killed me,’ I said. ‘Did not want me breathing coal dust and smoke. He said pick one poison.’</p>
<p data-pid="p090">‘And you picked guitars,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p091">‘Seemed reasonable.’</p>
<p data-pid="p092">She blew out a long stream of smoke, eyes half closed.</p>
<p data-pid="p093">‘So,’ she said. ‘What do you think?’</p>
<p data-pid="p094">‘About?’</p>
<p data-pid="p095">She jerked her head at the noise from inside.</p>
<p data-pid="p096">‘All this,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p097">I looked up and down the street. Posters for gigs, for strip clubs, for language courses. A man sleeping in a doorway with a charity leaflet under his head.</p>
<p data-pid="p098">‘I think it is big and clever and moving,’ I said. ‘And I think the government will love it, because it lets them act like this is a natural disaster, not a political one.’</p>
<p data-pid="p099">‘You are not wrong,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p100">‘They froze our union money,’ I said, heat rising. ‘Called us thugs. Now they get to sit on sofas and feel virtuous because they have sent a tenner to Addis. Nobody on that stage is talking about that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p101">‘Some of them are,’ she said. ‘In interviews, on local radio. It is not all in the big broadcast.’</p>
<p data-pid="p102">‘But the broadcast is what counts,’ I said. ‘That is what will sit in people's memories. The big shots and the big songs. No scabby details about the IMF or British policy. Just feelings.’</p>
<p data-pid="p103">I heard my own tone and winced. Jealous of a concert.</p>
<p data-pid="p104">‘You do not trust feelings?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p105">‘I do not trust feelings on their own,’ I said. ‘Feelings are what you get when 'enemy within' comes over the news and half the country nods along.’</p>
<p data-pid="p106">Charlotte leaned back against the wall, looking straight at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p107">‘You know how many people I have seen switch off when you start talking about legislation?’ she said. ‘Or Orgreave reports? Their eyes glaze. But if they hear one song that gets under their skin, they might stay in the room long enough for the rest.’</p>
<p data-pid="p108">‘That is what I am doing in damp basements for twenty people,’ I said. ‘No cameras, no helicopter shots. Just sweat and cheap lager and a battered PA.’</p>
<p data-pid="p109">‘And that matters,’ she said. ‘It is the same thing, just smaller. You think half the kids who will write essays about Live Aid in fifteen years will have been anywhere near Wembley?’</p>
<p data-pid="p110">‘You are very sure of the essays,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p111">‘I am a snob,’ she said, shrugging. ‘We measure things in footnotes where I come from.’</p>
<p data-pid="p112">She flicked ash into the gutter.</p>
<p data-pid="p113">‘Look,’ she said. ‘Is it messy? Of course. Are some of them doing it for their image? Yes. Will the Tories try and ride on it? Obviously. But for millions of people today, the biggest stars they know are saying 'this is not okay'. That shifts something. Maybe only a little. Enough that when you lot put out a tape or organise a gig, there is a crack to pour into.’</p>
<p data-pid="p114">I thought of the Ethiopia woman in the pub; of Shell's files stacked on her kitchen table next to homework; of Geldof yelling at the camera.</p>
<p data-pid="p115">‘You are very optimistic for someone who spends so much time in darkrooms,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p116">‘I am pragmatic,’ she said. ‘Spectacle gets you attention. Then you decide what to do with it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p117">She stepped closer, close enough that I could see the coal flecks of mascara at the ends of her lashes.</p>
<p data-pid="p118">‘Besides,’ she said softly. ‘You are just annoyed you are not on that stage.’</p>
<p data-pid="p119">‘Maybe,’ I said. ‘Maybe I think it would have done people good to see a miner's lad up there calling her out.’</p>
<p data-pid="p120">‘You are calling her out,’ Charlotte said. ‘You just have not got your stadium yet.’</p>
<p data-pid="p121">She reached up, fingertip brushing the tally disc under my T-shirt.</p>
<p data-pid="p122">‘You carry a pit round your neck every day,’ she said. ‘There is no way you are not going to build something with that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p123">Something slow and deliberate flipped in my chest. Her face was inches away now, smoke and mint on her breath, Live Aid's echo pressing at our backs.</p>
<p data-pid="p124">‘Charlotte—’ I started.</p>
<p data-pid="p125">She kissed me. Or I kissed her. It met in the middle, mouths finding each other with the ease of something that had been waiting its turn. For a moment the rest of it fell away – cameras, stadium, slogans. Just her hand in my hair, the rough brick at my back, the knowledge that if the world was watching anything, it was not this.</p>
<p data-pid="p126">When we broke apart, we both laughed, a bit startled.</p>
<p data-pid="p127">‘Sorry,’ I said, out of habit.</p>
<p data-pid="p128">‘You really are,’ she said, amused. ‘We will work on that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p129">She stubbed her cigarette out on the step, then picked the butt up and put it in her pocket.</p>
<p data-pid="p130">‘Come on,’ she said. ‘If I have just snogged the enemy within, I had better go back in and take some photographs. Otherwise no one will believe me.’</p>
<p data-pid="p131">*</p>
<p data-pid="p132">We stayed until the light outside turned the colour of old beer and the telly people started talking about Philadelphia. People drifted off in clumps – to night shifts, babysitters, other pubs for the second half of the world-saving.</p>
<p data-pid="p133">Shell, Charlotte and I peeled away down a side street towards Dalston Junction. Alex had gone off with a boy who had smiled at him during U2, promising to catch us up. The Ethiopia group were packing their table, counting notes, faces tired but pleased.</p>
<p data-pid="p134">‘You should have seen Mam's face when they said it was going on till eleven,’ Shell said. ‘She thought music stopped at Top of the Pops.’</p>
<p data-pid="p135">She walked between us, one hand lightly on Charlotte's elbow to keep her from stepping into the road. Her other hand trailed along the railings, fingertips catching on peeling paint.</p>
<p data-pid="p136">‘How is everything really?’ I asked quietly.</p>
<p data-pid="p137">She took a breath.</p>
<p data-pid="p138">‘Victoria is doing miracles with nowt,’ she said. ‘Lily is… a kid. She bounces. Then she does not. Then she does again. Eddie is...’ She searched for the words. ‘He is proud. And he is angry. And he is there, which is more than I can say for some.’</p>
<p data-pid="p139">‘And you?’ Charlotte asked gently.</p>
<p data-pid="p140">‘I am somewhere between here and there,’ Shell said. ‘When I am home, I miss this. When I am here, I miss them. Sometimes I think I am just the bit of rope everyone is pulling on from both ends.’</p>
<p data-pid="p141">She tipped her head back, looking at the thin strip of sky between buildings.</p>
<p data-pid="p142">‘I keep telling myself it is better to be stretched than to lie flat,’ she said. ‘But it does get tiring.’</p>
<p data-pid="p143">‘We are going to need you,’ I said. ‘Whatever we build. Whatever comes next.’</p>
<p data-pid="p144">‘You will have me,’ she said easily. ‘Question is whether my knees will hold out.’</p>
<p data-pid="p145">We turned a corner and almost walked straight into it.</p>
<p data-pid="p146">A warehouse, or what had been one. Three storeys of soot-stained brick, windows boarded. Old metal letters traced a faint company name over the main door, most of them fallen. A TO LET sign hung at an angle, corners curling. Someone had spray-painted a rude word across it in thick black.</p>
<p data-pid="p147">‘This used to be a printers,’ Charlotte said. ‘School trips. Ink everywhere. You would go home with it on your hands for days.’</p>
<p data-pid="p148">‘What is it now?’ Shell asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p149">‘Nothing,’ Charlotte said. ‘Been empty a year at least.’</p>
<p data-pid="p150">We stood on the pavement, looking up.</p>
<p data-pid="p151">‘You could fit a lot of people in there,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p152">‘And a stage,’ Shell said.</p>
<p data-pid="p153">‘And rooms,’ Charlotte said. ‘Workshops. Offices. A studio.’</p>
<p data-pid="p154">‘A crèche,’ Shell added. ‘If we are dreaming, we are dreaming properly.’</p>
<p data-pid="p155">I pictured it with the boards off, windows lit. A hall where you could play loud enough to rattle glass without a landlord banging on the ceiling. A side room with a battered table where people could spread out papers about housing benefit and bail. Another with a tape deck whirring, someone copying cassettes to send who knew where. Posters not just for gigs but for meetings, for strikes, for whatever came next.</p>
<p data-pid="p156">‘We could have our own cameras,’ I said slowly. ‘Our own mics. Our own… everything. No waiting for the BBC to turn up if they feel like it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p157">‘A place people know they can come,’ Shell said. ‘Not just for music. For advice. For a bit of warmth.’</p>
<p data-pid="p158">‘Like a community centre,’ Charlotte said, ‘but noisier.’</p>
<p data-pid="p159">A taxi blared; we stepped back, but none of us walked away.</p>
<p data-pid="p160">‘I keep thinking about today,’ I said. ‘Every telly, every radio, every pub. They have filled the country with this. You cannot get away from it even if you want to.’</p>
<p data-pid="p161">‘That is the idea,’ Charlotte said.</p>
<p data-pid="p162">‘What if we did that on our own scale?’ I said. ‘Not global. But a place where things start and go out. Tapes, gigs, leaflets. Somewhere that throws out heat instead of just soaking it up.’</p>
<p data-pid="p163">I looked at Charlotte.</p>
<p data-pid="p164">‘You remember what you told me after the 100 Club gig? About heat. You said if we find somewhere to keep it contained and focused, it could power something.’</p>
<p data-pid="p165">She nodded slowly, eyes brightening with recognition.</p>
<p data-pid="p166">Shell looked at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p167">‘You mean like a furnace,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p168">The word landed between us, obvious and perfect.</p>
<p data-pid="p169">‘Yeah,’ I said. ‘Like a furnace.’</p>
<p data-pid="p170">Charlotte smiled slowly.</p>
<p data-pid="p171">‘The Furnace,’ she said. ‘Sounds like a band, or a threat.’</p>
<p data-pid="p172">‘Bit of both,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p173">We stood there, three specks on a London pavement, staring at an empty building and seeing it full.</p>
<p data-pid="p174">‘We have not got money,’ Shell said eventually.</p>
<p data-pid="p175">‘We did not have money for food last winter,’ I said. ‘Still fed people.’</p>
<p data-pid="p176">‘We would need permits, licences, someone to sign the lease, people who can talk bank without being sick in their own mouths,’ Charlotte said.</p>
<p data-pid="p177">‘You know some of those,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p178">She nodded, eyes on the blank windows.</p>
<p data-pid="p179">‘I do,’ she said. ‘They would hate it. Which makes it all the more appealing.’</p>
<p data-pid="p180">We started walking again, but my head stayed in there, in the echo. I could hear drums on a soundcheck, the scrape of chairs for a tenants' meeting, kids' feet thudding down a corridor. Shell at a table with a pile of forms. Charlotte with a camera. Alex on stage messing about with levels. Me in all of it, not just trying to catch up with history but building a place it had to pass through.</p>
<p data-pid="p181">Back at the house, much later – Alex snoring on the mattress, Shell half-asleep on spare blankets – I sat on the floor with a tape in my hands. The telly showed the end of the American leg, presenters hoarse, crowd lit up like a new galaxy.</p>
<p data-pid="p182">I took a pen and wrote on the label: LIVE AID – THOUGHTS.</p>
<p data-pid="p183">Underneath, in smaller letters, I added one word: FURNACE.</p>
<p data-pid="p184">It looked ridiculous and important at the same time.</p>
<p data-pid="p185">The words felt like the start of a chord, the first grip on a fretboard. I turned the tape over, feeling its weight, imagining it multiplied by hundreds, spooling out through letterboxes and into battered machines in living rooms and union offices and pubs.</p>
<p data-pid="p186">Someone on the telly said history had been made. Maybe it had. All I knew was that something had shifted in me, something that looked less like a dream of a record deal and more like brick, mortar and cables.</p>
<p data-pid="p187">A furnace, I thought, and for the first time it did not just mean the pit.</p></div>
