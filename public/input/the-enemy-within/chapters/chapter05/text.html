<div class="chapter" data-chapter-id="chapter05"><p data-pid="p000">Chapter Five – October 1984, London – Brighton Bombing and 100 Club</p>
<p data-pid="p001">By October we had moved out of the single-room bedsit and into rooms in a slightly less miserable house — still small, still damp, but with actual doors you could close, and a landlady downstairs who guarded her hallway phone like it was crown jewels.</p>
<p data-pid="p002">The radio came on at half six like someone snapping a switch in my skull.</p>
<p data-pid="p003">‘…exploded at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where the Conservative Party Conference is taking place. The Prime Minister is safe, but there are reports of casualties…’</p>
<p data-pid="p004">Conference. Hotel. Bomb.</p>
<p data-pid="p005">It took a second for the words to arrange themselves into anything that meant something. I pushed myself up on my elbows in the narrow bed and fumbled for the dial, trying to clear the static from the presenter’s voice. Through the thin wall I could hear Alex moving about, his alarm no doubt tuned to the same programme.</p>
<p data-pid="p006">As the details filtered in – early hours, load-bearing walls gone, whole floors opened to the air like a dolls' house – a cold weight settled behind my ribs. Thatcher had been in the hotel and somehow walked away. Other people had not.</p>
<p data-pid="p007">The kettle started to boil. I stumbled into the kitchenette, slopped instant coffee granules into a mug and missed half the time, hands clumsy. The bulletin moved on to eyewitness reports and the first trickle of numbers. Four dead, maybe more. Norman Tebbit pulled from the rubble, his wife badly hurt.</p>
<p data-pid="p008">I crossed the corridor and knocked on Alex's door. He opened it in his boxers with the radio pressed to his ear, face set in a way that told me he had been listening long enough.</p>
<p data-pid="p009">‘You hearing this?’</p>
<p data-pid="p010">He held the radio away from his head. ‘Aye. You reckon it is the Provos?’</p>
<p data-pid="p011">‘No one has claimed it yet.’ I felt my jaw tightening. ‘They had a bloody go, though.’</p>
<p data-pid="p012">We stood side by side in his doorway as the bulletin rolled on, the cheap carpet rough under my bare feet. Someone had pushed a bomb behind the plaster of a Brighton hotel so that it went off when nearly the entire Cabinet was asleep in their beds. The commentator said it like an item on a shopping list.</p>
<p data-pid="p013">Thatcher’s statement came on. ‘This attack has failed. All attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.’ She sounded furious and oddly triumphant, as if the bomb had given her something she had secretly wanted all along.</p>
<p data-pid="p014">A small, shameful spark lit up inside me at the thought that someone had tried to put real fear in her. Let her feel for once what our lot felt when horses came at them in the dark with batons swinging.</p>
<p data-pid="p015">The spark died almost as soon as it flared. Four people dead, and none of them her. Tory delegates, MPs, wives. People whose worst crime had been going to sleep in the wrong building. Whatever satisfaction I thought I would feel tasted sour, like metal.</p>
<p data-pid="p016">Alex clicked the radio off. The sudden silence made the flat feel even smaller.</p>
<p data-pid="p017">‘You still up for tonight?’ he asked. ‘We can ring Lewis and pull it if you like.’</p>
<p data-pid="p018">The gig. Nine days of rehearsals, Pete finally locking the bass line for Enemy Within into place, Tommy learning to play just behind the beat so the songs did not gallop away from us. The thought of plugging into an amp and pretending the world had not shifted overnight felt absurd.</p>
<p data-pid="p019">‘No,’ I said. ‘We do it. More than ever.’</p>
<p data-pid="p020">*</p>
<p data-pid="p021">By the time we had dressed, the others had surfaced. The kitchen was thick with steam from cheap tea and the smell of toast on the edge of burning. Rowan sat at the table, bare chest, tattoo ink disappearing under the waistband of his jeans, cigarette already on the go. Riz leaned against the counter stirring sugar into a chipped mug as if it had personally offended him.</p>
<p data-pid="p022">‘You hear about Brighton?’ Rowan said, eyes bright in a way that made my stomach twist.</p>
<p data-pid="p023">‘Hard to miss,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p024">‘About time someone took a proper swing at them,’ he went on. ‘She has had lads’ heads cracked open all year. See how she likes it when—’</p>
<p data-pid="p025">‘Rowan.’ Alex’s voice came out sharper than usual.</p>
<p data-pid="p026">‘What? I am not crying for them. Tories in a posh hotel, boo-bloody-hoo.’</p>
<p data-pid="p027">Riz shrugged, not quite looking at either of them. 'Course it was going to happen sooner or later. You squeeze people hard enough, something goes bang. That is history.'</p>
<p data-pid="p028">'That is four people dead,' I said. 'And whoever they were, they are dead now. That is not a win.'</p>
<p data-pid="p029">Rowan blew smoke towards the ceiling. 'Collateral damage. They invented that phrase, not us.'</p>
<p data-pid="p030">'Aye, and they are welcome to keep it,' I said. 'I want her out, not in bits. And whoever died in there did not deserve it just because they were in the wrong hotel.'</p>
<p data-pid="p031">The room tightened round it. The kettle boiled dry with a little tick, unnoticed.</p>
<p data-pid="p032">Alex set his mug down carefully. 'Violence like that just writes their speeches for them,' he said. 'They get to stand in front of cameras and talk about “democracy under attack”, and anything we say about pits and police and hunger sounds like background static. Static we are providing for free, by the way.'</p>
<p data-pid="p033">‘So what then?’ Rowan demanded. ‘Songs? Do not think she is scared of your guitar, Danny.’</p>
<p data-pid="p034">‘I know she is not,’ I said. ‘But the bomb did not scare her either. It just made her harder.’</p>
<p data-pid="p035">Riz gave a low whistle. ‘You are both wrong,’ he said. ‘Guitars and bombs. All it ever does is give journalists a story. They love blood and feedback. What they cannot photograph is slow grinding down of an entire county.’</p>
<p data-pid="p036">He tipped the last of the tea into his mouth, made a face and put the mug down.</p>
<p data-pid="p037">‘You lot argue about tactics. I am going to have a wash before the hot water goes.’</p>
<p data-pid="p038">He left us there, three knots of anger pointing in different directions.</p>
<p data-pid="p039">Alex picked up his mug again. 'Art is slow,' he said quietly. 'Takes time to get under the skin. Bombs are fast. They blow everything up and then people rush in to tell you what it meant. I know which job I would rather do, even if it feels pointless half the time.'</p>
<p data-pid="p040">I thought of Dad's tally disc, heavy under my shirt, of Shell's words, of the spools of tape stacked on the windowsill.</p>
<p data-pid="p041">In 2025, when Keira asks me when it stopped just being anger, when it became something more, I will point to this morning. Not the strike itself, but this moment: realising that art was slow, bombs were fast, and we needed something in between. Something loud enough to cut through but stubborn enough to last. That was the first fingerprint, though we did not call it that yet. Noise.</p>
<p data-pid="p042">'Then let us make sure the slow thing actually does something,' I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p043">*</p>
<p data-pid="p044">By late afternoon I was on Oxford Street, killing time before the 100 Club, walking without purpose except the one I refused to name. Traffic crawled, buses threw out grey exhaust into the damp air, shoppers flowed around me in thick autumn coats with branded carrier bags hooked over their wrists as if it were any other Friday.</p>
<p data-pid="p045">Outside a newsagent, tabloids were stacked in a shouting wall of type – IRON LADY DEFIES BOMB, TERROR STRIKE ON TORIES. A photograph of the Grand Hotel with its guts hanging out dominated every front page. In one picture, firemen in yellow helmets picked through rubble that had been someone’s room an hour before.</p>
<p data-pid="p046">A builder in paint-splattered overalls leaned against the door of a café, yawning, too knackered to bother with the papers. Somewhere, someone had come off a night shift and gone straight to bed without knowing the country had shifted shape while they worked.</p>
<p data-pid="p047">For a second I imagined a different headline: PRIME MINISTER KILLED IN BLAST. Tried it on like a shirt. My stomach turned. It was not righteousness, what I felt. It was the sick curiosity you get slowing past a crash.</p>
<p data-pid="p048">I folded the paper under my arm and kept walking.</p>
<p data-pid="p049">The 100 Club entrance sat under street level, exactly where it always had, a red sign glowing above the stairs down into the dark. From the pavement, you would never know half the bands that had changed people's lives had sweated under that ceiling. That night it looked more than ever like a shelter.</p>
<p data-pid="p050">Inside, the air was thick with cigarette smoke and the faint tang of damp brick. Near the entrance end there was a little green room, the kind of place that pretended privacy with a door and failed. Two battered chairs, a cracked mirror that made you look like you'd been in a fight, a sink, and a toilet door that did not quite catch.</p>
<p data-pid="p051">We were all crammed in there with our cases and nerves. Alex sat with his Rickenbacker across his lap, fingers moving soundlessly. Pete crouched by his bass, turning the volume knob back and forth like he could dial his fear down with it. Tommy rolled his shoulders and tapped his sticks against his thigh, eyes closed.</p>
<p data-pid="p052">‘You look like you have swallowed the shipping forecast,’ Alex said, glancing up.</p>
<p data-pid="p053">‘I have swallowed the news,’ I said. ‘We are going on in an hour and someone has tried to blow up the government.’</p>
<p data-pid="p054">He nodded, a quick tilt of the chin. ‘So what do we say?’</p>
<p data-pid="p055">That was the question that had been chewing on me since six-thirty. It felt childish now, scribbling lyrics about pit closures and scabs when someone had wired real explosives into a hotel wall. Our three chords had not stopped a single closure. A bomb had not toppled her either. Somewhere between those two failures was this – shouting in a basement club, strings and spit and sweat.</p>
<p data-pid="p056">‘We say what we were going to say,’ I said eventually. ‘But we do not pretend this did not happen. We are not in a different world just because we have a soundcheck.’</p>
<p data-pid="p057">Alex plucked a few notes, listening to how they bounced off the low ceiling.</p>
<p data-pid="p058">‘Fine by me,’ he said. ‘Just remember I cannot play a manifesto solo.’</p>
<p data-pid="p059">The MC stuck his head round the green-room door to check we were alive, then vanished again. I leaned out into the club for a second, letting the room hit me.</p>
<p data-pid="p060">When we stepped onto the stage, you could read a whole sociology of London in thirty seconds.</p>
<p data-pid="p061">Down at the front, as close to the monitors as they could get, were the familiars – kids from squats and council blocks, leather jackets with the sleeves coming away at the seams, battered boots, DIY tattoos, hair held up with more hope than product. Badges clustered on lapels – CND, Rock Against Racism, Coal Not Dole badges like mine on a surprising number of chests.</p>
<p data-pid="p062">To the left of the bar, a knot of art school types lounged with their pints, in black polo necks and carefully tousled hair, cigarettes held just so. They looked like they had come straight from a seminar on Brecht.</p>
<p data-pid="p063">Near the back, almost in their own weather system, was a little island of polish. Clean boots, wool overcoats cut to look casual, scarves that matched gloves, glossy hair that had seen a proper hairdresser. A couple of laminated passes still hanging round necks – a local free paper, a radio station, something with the BBC logo in the corner. They stood with that slight lean of people who were used to having room, even in crowded places.</p>
<p data-pid="p064">Threading between them all was a young woman with a camera slung round her neck, strap cutting across a navy duffel coat that looked like it had never seen a washing line. Dark hair twisted up with a scarf, eyeliner neat even in the low red light. Every so often she lifted the camera, caught a face or a cluster of badges, then moved on, utterly at ease.</p>
<p data-pid="p065">Down near the front, by one of the pillars, a lad in a denim jacket stood holding another boy’s hand, thumb rubbing slow circles over the back of it. They had matching quiffs and matching nervous smiles, the sort you wore when you knew the world still thought you were a joke at best and a threat at worst. Each time the house music kicked up, they moved a little closer together.</p>
<p data-pid="p066">The MC’s voice came over the PA. ‘All right, you lot. Give a welcome to Coalface!’</p>
<p data-pid="p067">We walked out to the small stir of applause and the scrape of glasses set down on sticky tables. I slung my guitar strap over my shoulder, checked the mic height, tried not to look like my hands were shaking.</p>
<p data-pid="p068">‘Evening,’ I said. ‘We are Coalface. This first one is for anyone whose morning started with bad news and just kept going. It is called Coal Not Dole.’</p>
<p data-pid="p069">Tommy counted us in and we hit it. Pete’s bass line locked with the kick drum, Alex’s guitar cutting in jagged, clear phrases. The song felt bigger now with the full band behind it, words I had scribbled in our kitchen suddenly filling a room lined with faces.</p>
<p data-pid="p070">By the second chorus, the front row were shouting the title back at me. A pint slopped over someone's sleeve and nobody cared. The two lads by the pillar were moving in time now, shoulders bumping with every beat.</p>
<p data-pid="p071">We ran straight into Lines on a Map, then a new one Alex had bullied me into finishing about the lads still going in at non-striking pits. The more we played, the easier it was to forget my own doubts and let the noise carry me.</p>
<p data-pid="p072">Three songs in, sweat prickling at my collar, I stepped up to the microphone again.</p>
<p data-pid="p073">'You all seen the front pages?' I asked. 'Brighton?'</p>
<p data-pid="p074">A murmur rolled round the room, the kind that was half agreement, half waiting to see where you were going.</p>
<p data-pid="p075">'Some bastard thought the best way to deal with this lot was to knock a hole in a hotel,' I went on. 'Four dead, and it is none of the ones who closed the pits.'</p>
<p data-pid="p076">Someone at the back shouted something I did not catch. Another voice nearer the front yelled, 'Should have finished the job!' A few people cheered, too loud.</p>
<p data-pid="p077">I felt my throat tighten. ‘Yes, I am angry,’ I said. ‘I have been angry since March. But if we start cheering when people we have never met get blown up in their beds, we are not on the side I thought we were on.’</p>
<p data-pid="p078">It came out harsher than I meant, but I did not take it back.</p>
<p data-pid="p079">‘They call us the enemy within,’ I said, hearing my own song title as I spoke. ‘Fine. This next one is about what that feels like when you are on a picket line instead of in a hotel.’</p>
<p data-pid="p080">Pete hit the opening note of Enemy Within and the room rose to meet it. Whatever they thought of my little speech, the riff landed. I sang about lines of police and cameras and the moment you realised your own government thought you were a threat to be managed rather than a citizen to be listened to. In the middle eight, I caught the eye of the young lad by the pillar. He was yelling every word, face lit up, hand still wrapped in his boyfriend’s. For a second it felt like the song belonged to him as much as to any miner.</p>
<p data-pid="p081">We finished with Furnace Town, the one about the village as an engine, heat stored in every terrace and club and band room. By the last chorus it felt like the whole place was singing it at me rather than with me.</p>
<p data-pid="p082">Then it was done. The cheer went up, louder than I had expected. We left a skid of feedback hanging in the air and came off the stage on shaking legs, weaving back down the length of the room to the green room by the entrance, hearts thumping, ears ringing.</p>
<p data-pid="p083">Lewis, appeared with four damp pint glasses.</p>
<p data-pid="p084">‘Good set, lads,’ he said, handing them out. ‘Proper stuff.’</p>
<p data-pid="p085">Behind him, another man hovered, late forties maybe, in an old work jacket with a battered NUM badge on the lapel. He had the look of someone who had been around enough marches to know where the toilets were before he found the bar.</p>
<p data-pid="p086">‘You are Danny, right?’ he asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p087">‘Yes.’</p>
<p data-pid="p088">He shook my hand, grip like a shovel. ‘Name is Colin. I help run the miners’ support group round here. We have had your tapes at our meetings. Solid work.’</p>
<p data-pid="p089">‘Cheers,’ I said, feeling a ridiculous flush of pride.</p>
<p data-pid="p090">He took a sip of his beer, then jerked his chin towards the closed door that led back to the club.</p>
<p data-pid="p091">‘You know everyone in that room already hates her, do you not?’</p>
<p data-pid="p092">I blinked. ‘What?’</p>
<p data-pid="p093">‘Thatcher,’ he said. ‘You could set fire to a portrait of her on stage and they would just clap louder. You are preaching to a choir that has been singing since seventy-nine.’</p>
<p data-pid="p094">The words landed with an accuracy that made my skin prickle. Somewhere behind him, someone laughed; someone else dropped an empty glass in a crate.</p>
<p data-pid="p095">‘So what do we do instead?’ I asked, more sharply than I meant.</p>
<p data-pid="p096">He shrugged. ‘I am not saying do not play the gigs. We need the money and morale. Just… do not fool yourself that this is where the real fight is. The ones who matter are at home watching the telly, or in offices deciding what goes on the telly. Those are the heads you have got to get into.’</p>
<p data-pid="p097">He clapped my shoulder and slipped back out through the green-room door before I could answer, leaving the thought sitting there, heavy as an amp in the middle of the floor.</p>
<p data-pid="p098">Alex handed me my pint. ‘You look like someone has just told you Santa is a cop,’ he said.</p>
<p data-pid="p099">‘Maybe he is,’ I muttered, but my mind was still on the room beyond the thin wall. On the little island of polish near the back. On the camera strap across the duffel coat.</p>
<p data-pid="p100">When we went out to the bar area, the air hit us like a warm wet cloth. People came up in ones and twos to say they liked the set, to ask about tapes, to shove crumpled fivers into my hand for strike funds. Mo, the zine girl, appeared, cheeks flushed, waving a new issue with a rough photocopy of our name on the back page.</p>
<p data-pid="p101">‘You lot are on page three,’ she said proudly. ‘I will drop some copies at your place.’</p>
<p data-pid="p102">I promised I would read every word. She grinned, then vanished back into the crowd.</p>
<p data-pid="p103">And then the girl with the camera was in front of us.</p>
<p data-pid="p104">‘Sorry,’ she said, pushing a strand of hair back with her wrist. ‘Could I steal thirty seconds for a couple of shots? You were… well. Worth photographing.’</p>
<p data-pid="p105">She sounded south of the river but south of my class as well. Proper vowels, the kind that had been ironed flat at expensive schools.</p>
<p data-pid="p106">Alex, being Alex, grinned immediately. ‘Steal away.’</p>
<p data-pid="p107">She stepped back, lifted the camera and took us in quickly: a tight shot of the four of us, then singles, then a close-up on my Coal Not Dole badge. The flash scraped white across my eyes and left the room washed in momentary after-images.</p>
<p data-pid="p108">'Who is it for?' I asked, when she lowered the camera.</p>
<p data-pid="p109">'Freelance piece,' she said. 'I do bits for a student paper and a couple of little magazines. The conference coverage is going to be wall-to-wall suits and speeches after today. I thought it might be interesting to see what the other side of the country's mood looks like.'</p>
<p data-pid="p110">'The angry, sweaty side?' Alex said.</p>
<p data-pid="p111">She smiled. 'Exactly.'</p>
<p data-pid="p112">'You from round here?' I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p113">'London, yes,' she said. 'I was supposed to be doing photos around the conference — delegates coming and going, protesters outside, the fringe bits they pretend are not the story — but after this morning I knew I did not want to spend the night watching men in blue suits tell the nation what to think about what had just happened.'</p>
<p data-pid="p114">‘So you came to watch some lads in black jeans instead,’ Alex said.</p>
<p data-pid="p115">‘A girl has to have her vices,’ she said lightly. Then, to me: ‘I am Charlotte, by the way. Charlotte Haversham.’</p>
<p data-pid="p116">The surname tugged at something. I had seen it in print, I was sure of it, but London was full of Havershams in my imagination – they lived in the big houses you cycled past on the way to the bus stop.</p>
<p data-pid="p117">‘Danny,’ I said. ‘This is Alex, Pete, Tommy.’</p>
<p data-pid="p118">We shook hands. Her fingers were cool and ink-smudged, like she had been handling type rather than people.</p>
<p data-pid="p119">Over her shoulder, I could see the little island of polish at the back of the room – one of the blokes with the BBC logo on his pass laughing at something, coat shrugged off, shirt cuffs rolled. They were talking about us, I realised, without being able to hear a word. We were their story for the night. They would go back to their offices and decide what, if anything, it meant.</p>
<p data-pid="p120">I leaned closer to Alex, keeping my voice low.</p>
<p data-pid="p121">‘Colin is right,’ I said. ‘We are shouting at the wrong people. Those lot—’ I jerked my chin towards the passes and perfect hair ‘—they are the ones who go back to BBC offices and Parliament internships. We need some of them on our side if we want this to travel further than basement clubs and pit villages.’</p>
<p data-pid="p122">I had not meant her to hear, but Charlotte’s eyebrows rose a fraction.</p>
<p data-pid="p123">‘Dangerous thing to say in front of a walking press pass,’ she said, not offended so much as interested.</p>
<p data-pid="p124">‘You one of them, then?’ I asked. ‘The enemy without?’</p>
<p data-pid="p125">‘That is Argentina,’ Alex put in. ‘Keep up.’</p>
<p data-pid="p126">She laughed, quick and bright, then sobered. 'No. I am sort of… parallel,' she said. 'My father is an MP. Conservative backbencher. He thinks I am covering the conference for my journalism course. In a way I am — the bits outside the ballroom — just not his version of it.'</p>
<p data-pid="p127">‘Christ,’ Alex said. ‘You are one of them and you are one of us.’</p>
<p data-pid="p128">‘Or neither,’ she said. ‘Depends who you ask.’</p>
<p data-pid="p129">I reached into my jacket pocket and pulled out one of the cassettes we had brought to sell. Hand-drawn cover, our name in my careful block letters, a folded insert with a typed account of Orgreave that Shell had sent down from Grimethorpe.</p>
<p data-pid="p130">'Here,' I said. 'This has our songs and a first-hand account of Orgreave from someone who was there. Might give you something for your article that is not Tebbit's plaster cast.'</p>
<p data-pid="p131">Charlotte turned the tape over in her hands, reading the label. 'Orgreave: The Real Story,' she read aloud. 'Ambitious.'</p>
<p data-pid="p132">'It is just our songs and a written account tucked inside the case,' I said. 'But she was there. That is more than most of the people who get to talk about it on telly.'</p>
<p data-pid="p133">‘Thank you,’ she said, and slipped the cassette into her camera bag as if it were another lens. ‘I will listen. And I might come and find you for a quote or two if that is all right.’</p>
<p data-pid="p134">‘As long as you do not make us sound cleverer than we are,’ Alex said. ‘It will ruin our street cred.’</p>
<p data-pid="p135">She smiled. ‘I promise to make you sound exactly as clever as you are. Which, for the record, is more than you think.’</p>
<p data-pid="p136">*</p>
<p data-pid="p137">We ended up outside together later, after the load-out. The rain had stopped but the pavement was still slick, catching reflections from traffic lights and shop windows. Alex disappeared up the street with Tommy to find a kebab place that would still serve at that hour. Pete had found someone to talk about bass guitars with and was not likely to reappear for an hour.</p>
<p data-pid="p138">Charlotte lingered by the club door, camera bag at her feet, hands tucked into her duffel pockets.</p>
<p data-pid="p139">‘Do you want a coffee?’ she asked, a little abruptly. ‘There is a place round the corner that does dreadful espresso and halfway decent cake. My treat. Consider it payment for the tape.’</p>
<p data-pid="p140">Everything in me wanted chips with the lads and then my bed. Another part – the part that had been watching the little island of polish and thinking about Colin’s words – pricked its ears up.</p>
<p data-pid="p141">‘All right,’ I said. ‘As long as you do not mind me smelling like a brewery and a wet dog.’</p>
<p data-pid="p142">‘I have just been in the same room,’ she said. ‘I am acclimatised.’</p>
<p data-pid="p143">The café was one of those narrow jobs with steamed-up windows and chrome stools, trying hard to look continental and almost succeeding. A Smiths song played faintly from a radio in the back. I felt scruffy just walking in, aware of the rips in my jeans and the ink ground into my fingernails.</p>
<p data-pid="p144">Charlotte ordered in the easy way of someone used to having their choices written down in front of them. Two coffees, one slice of something that turned out to be orange and almond cake. She paid without looking at the coins.</p>
<p data-pid="p145">We sat opposite each other in a booth near the back. The coffee was as advertised – dreadful – but it was hot and it woke my brain up.</p>
<p data-pid="p146">‘Do you always give away your work that easily?’ she asked, nodding at my empty pocket.</p>
<p data-pid="p147">‘We sell most of them,’ I said. ‘But some need to go to the right people. If you can get Shell’s voice into a place my dad has never been, that is worth more than a quid fifty.’</p>
<p data-pid="p148">She considered that. ‘You talk in networks,’ she said. ‘You know that?’</p>
<p data-pid="p149">‘What?’</p>
<p data-pid="p150">'Nodes and connections. Tapes going here, people going there. Most bands I write about talk about themselves. You talk about routes.'</p>
<p data-pid="p151">I shrugged, embarrassed. 'I just do not want it all stuck in one room,' I said. 'A man at the club tonight told me we are brilliant at shouting at people who already agree. If we are going to call ourselves the enemy within, we may as well actually get inside somewhere that matters.'</p>
<p data-pid="p152">She smiled, but there was something serious sitting behind it.</p>
<p data-pid="p153">‘My father sits on committees,’ she said. ‘He has lunch with people who decide which stories go on which page. I grew up listening to them talk about miners and unions like they were weather systems. Storms that would pass.’</p>
<p data-pid="p154">‘And what do you think we are?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p155">She traced a circle on the tabletop with her finger, as if drawing something only she could see.</p>
<p data-pid="p156">'I think you are heat,' she said. 'Not a storm. Heat under things. If you find somewhere to keep it contained and focused, it could power something. If you just let it flare up and die down, it will warm a few nights and that is it.'</p>
<p data-pid="p157">I thought about that. Heat contained and focused. A place where all of it – the tapes, the bands, the support groups, people like her who could slip through doors we could not – could come together instead of scattering into the dark.</p>
<p data-pid="p158">'We need somewhere,' I said slowly. 'Not just gigs. Somewhere people can plug in. Bands, support groups, anyone who is sick of being told they are fringe.'</p>
<p data-pid="p159">Her eyes lit. 'Then find it,' she said. 'And let me know when you do. I can get people there who would not normally go near a picket line.'</p>
<p data-pid="p160">‘Why?’ I asked. ‘Why would you risk that? Your dad, your… everything.’</p>
<p data-pid="p161">She looked at me steadily over the rim of her cup.</p>
<p data-pid="p162">‘Because one day I would like to write about something other than the slow collapse of a country my father says is being saved,’ she said. ‘And because when you sang Enemy Within tonight, the boy by the pillar looked like someone had finally said out loud what has been living behind his eyes for years. That feels… important.’</p>
<p data-pid="p163">I thought of the lad’s hand wrapped in his boyfriend’s, the way his voice had cracked on the chorus.</p>
<p data-pid="p164">‘All right,’ I said. ‘When we have found a room and a way to pay the rent, you will be first to know.’</p>
<p data-pid="p165">She tore the cake in half and pushed a piece across to me.</p>
<p data-pid="p166">‘Deal,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p167">*</p>
<p data-pid="p168">Alex and I walked back to Camden later, our breath clouding in the cold, guitar cases pulling at our shoulders. The streets were quieter now, shop fronts dark, buses half empty.</p>
<p data-pid="p169">‘So,’ he said eventually. ‘Charlotte.’</p>
<p data-pid="p170">‘What about her?’</p>
<p data-pid="p171">‘Her dad is a Tory MP. She has got a camera and a press pass. She listens when you talk about networks instead of solos. That is either a gift from the gods or the set-up to a terrible joke.’</p>
<p data-pid="p172">‘Maybe both,’ I said. ‘Feels like something is starting, though.’</p>
<p data-pid="p173">‘The tapes-and-gigs thing?’ he asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p174">‘Yes. Tapes. Gigs. People like her who can slip through doors we cannot. Shell if she comes down. It is all bits at the minute, but… I do not know. Tonight felt like… not just noise.’</p>
<p data-pid="p175">Alex nodded, considering it. ‘Music alone is not enough,’ he said quietly. ‘But it is a good excuse to get the right people in the same room.’</p>
<p data-pid="p176">By the time we reached our building, my legs ached and my head was full. Above us, a scrap of paper pinned to our wall read HOUSE RULES? in my handwriting. Guitar cases leaned under the window, and a frayed amp lead lay taped and ready for tomorrow’s rehearsal.</p>
<p data-pid="p177">‘I am going to ring home,’ I said. ‘After today… I just need to hear a familiar voice.’</p>
<p data-pid="p178">‘Tell your dad we played a historic gig,’ Alex said, fumbling for his keys. ‘Leave out the bit where we nearly started a fight about terrorism.’</p>
<p data-pid="p179">The phone box near the tube still had a working receiver, though the directory hung in tatters. I fed coins into the slot and dialled home, suddenly desperate to bridge the miles between Oxford Street and the terraces.</p>
<p data-pid="p180">The tone purred twice, then clicked.</p>
<p data-pid="p181">‘Hello?’ Dad’s voice, thick with sleep. Of course – it was past midnight.</p>
<p data-pid="p182">‘Dad, it is me. Danny.’</p>
<p data-pid="p183">‘Danny? Christ, lad, what time is it? Are you all right?’</p>
<p data-pid="p184">The pips started immediately – three sharp bleeps demanding more coins. I fumbled in my pockets, panic rising. Two ten-pence pieces and a fifty. I fed them in quickly, knowing we had seconds before the line went dead.</p>
<p data-pid="p185">‘Yes, I am… I played a gig tonight. At the 100 Club.’</p>
<p data-pid="p186">Silence. Then: ‘That is good, son. I think.’</p>
<p data-pid="p187">‘I heard about Brighton,’ I said. ‘You all right there? Any bother?’</p>
<p data-pid="p188">‘We are fine,’ he said. ‘It is them down there that will be rattled. Do not like to think of bombs going off in hotels, mind. World has gone mad enough without that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p189">I leaned my forehead against the cool glass of the booth.</p>
<p data-pid="p190">‘Aye,’ I said. ‘That is sort of what I wanted to say. I am angry, Dad. All the time. But I do not want it to be that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p191">‘No,’ he said. ‘Nor me. There is enough widows up here as it is.’</p>
<p data-pid="p192">The pips started again, insistent. I shoved the last coin in.</p>
<p data-pid="p193">‘We are trying something else,’ I said quickly. ‘Me and some mates. Tapes, gigs, maybe… maybe more, if we can pull it off. Something that tells our side without… you know.’</p>
<p data-pid="p194">‘You do what you think is right,’ he said. ‘Just do not get yourself locked up. Your mam would kill me if I let that happen.’</p>
<p data-pid="p195">We both laughed, and for a moment the distance shrank.</p>
<p data-pid="p196">‘All right,’ I said. ‘Night, Dad.’</p>
<p data-pid="p197">‘Night, lad. And Danny?’</p>
<p data-pid="p198">‘Yes?’</p>
<p data-pid="p199">‘If you were on telly singing tonight instead of them in Brighton talking, I would have left the set on for once.’</p>
<p data-pid="p200">The line clicked and went dead. I stood there for a second, staring at my own reflection in the smeared glass. A miner's son in a leather jacket with a guitar callus on his thumb. One foot in a pit village, the other in a London basement, somewhere between bombs and ballads trying to find a way of fighting that did not make me sick.</p>
<p data-pid="p201">*</p>
<p data-pid="p202">Three days later I was still thinking about it – bombs and violence and the distance between what I wanted to happen and what I could live with – when someone knocked on our door. It was Martin, one of the lads who helped out at the solidarity centre, pale under his fringe.</p>
<p data-pid="p203">'You heard about Grimethorpe?' he said.</p>
<p data-pid="p204">My stomach dropped. 'What about Grimethorpe?'</p>
<p data-pid="p205">'Riots. Police arrested twenty-odd people for picking coal off the slag heap. It is all over the NUM grapevine.'</p>
<p data-pid="p206">I was down the stairs before he had finished the sentence.</p>
<p data-pid="p207">The landlord was downstairs in her hallway. I rapped on the doorframe, breathless.</p>
<p data-pid="p208">'I need to use the phone,' I said. 'Emergency. I will put coins in after.'</p>
<p data-pid="p209">She looked at me, at whatever was in my face, and nodded. She stepped aside from the little phone on her hallway table. 'Make it quick.'</p>
<p data-pid="p210">My hands shook as I dialled. The tone rang and rang, long enough for every terrible thought to crowd in – Dad arrested, Bobby arrested, someone hurt in the riot, police batons, cells, courts.</p>
<p data-pid="p211">Then Mam's voice, flat with exhaustion.</p>
<p data-pid="p212">'Daniel?'</p>
<p data-pid="p213">'Is Dad all right? Bobby? Who did they arrest?'</p>
<p data-pid="p214">A pause. I could hear her shifting the receiver, the scrape of a chair as she sat down at the kitchen table.</p>
<p data-pid="p215">'Your dad's fine. Bobby's fine. They arrested twenty-two for picking coal off the slag heap. Women and men both, Danny. Mrs Kaur from down the road. Frank's youngest lad. Old Jim who's seventy if he's a day.'</p>
<p data-pid="p216">'For picking coal?'</p>
<p data-pid="p217">'They said it was theft. Sent in fifty coppers like it was Orgreave all over again. There were bairns there, Danny. Families just trying to keep warm.'</p>
<p data-pid="p218">I pressed my forehead against the wall.</p>
<p data-pid="p219">'What is happening now?'</p>
<p data-pid="p220">'I have been at the welfare all night. We are getting them solicitors, organizing bail. Shell's doing a rota for court support.' Her voice cracked, just for a second. 'They are arresting people for trying not to freeze, love. That is where we are now.'</p>
<p data-pid="p221">I heard a sound in the background – voices, someone calling Mam's name.</p>
<p data-pid="p222">'I have to go,' she said. 'Arthur Holden is about to speak and I am meant to be taking notes for the press.'</p>
<p data-pid="p223">'Arthur Holden?'</p>
<p data-pid="p224">'From the union. He came to the cemetery this morning – where the old miners are buried – and he said…' She paused, gathering the words. '“This is a mining area. These people depend upon coal. If it is there and they have to pick it to keep their families warm, then they are going to do that and I do not think anybody should object.” He said it right to the cameras, Danny. Right to the coppers' faces.'</p>
<p data-pid="p225">Something fierce and proud swelled in my chest.</p>
<p data-pid="p226">'Tell him he is brilliant,' I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p227">'I will tell him you rang,' she said. 'Now I really do have to go. Stay safe, love.'</p>
<p data-pid="p228">The line went dead.</p>
<p data-pid="p229">I stood there in the landlord's hallway, receiver still in my hand. Mrs Kaur, who always had barley sugars in her pocket for the kids. Frank's youngest, who could not be more than eighteen. Old Jim, who had worked thirty years underground and now needed coal to survive the winter.</p>
<p data-pid="p230">Twenty-two arrests. In a village of six thousand.</p>
<p data-pid="p231">When I got back upstairs, Alex was waiting.</p>
<p data-pid="p232">'You all right?'</p>
<p data-pid="p233">I told him. All of it. The arrests, the riot, Arthur Holden at the cemetery, the Deputy Chief Constable who had apparently gone on television the next day to apologize – an almost unheard-of admission that the police had gone too far.</p>
<p data-pid="p234">Alex sat back, jaw tight.</p>
<p data-pid="p235">'They arrested them for picking coal,' he said slowly. 'In a mining village. During a miners' strike.'</p>
<p data-pid="p236">'Aye,' I said. 'That is where we are.'</p>
<p data-pid="p237">We looked at each other for a long moment. Brighton had been state violence from one side – bombs and blood and people pulled from rubble. This was state violence from the other – fifty coppers sent to arrest grandmothers and teenagers for trying to keep warm.</p>
<p data-pid="p238">'This needs to be in the next tape,' Alex said. 'People need to know.'</p>
<p data-pid="p239">I nodded, already reaching for the phone list.</p>
<p data-pid="p240">'I will get to the phone box and ring Shell,' I said. 'Get her to talk it through. Names, details, what Arthur said. We will get it down and get it out.'</p>
<p data-pid="p241">'Good,' Alex said. 'Because this – this is the story. Not the one they are telling on the news. The real one.'</p>
<p data-pid="p242">Outside, the city went on being itself. Somewhere in a hotel room, the Prime Minister slept with a police guard outside her door. Somewhere in Grimethorpe, my dad turned over and went back to sleep, and twenty-two people waited for their court dates.</p>
<p data-pid="p243">And in our flat, on a windowsill above Camden Road, twenty-odd cassettes cooled in their cases, waiting for the next pair of hands to pick them up and carry them somewhere we could not yet see.</p></div>
