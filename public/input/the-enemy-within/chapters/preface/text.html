<p data-pid="p001">There are places in this novel that are not mine.</p>
<p data-pid="p002">I have borrowed names—towns and villages and streets that hold real lives, real memories, and real griefs and joys. If, in doing so, I have caused offence or hurt—if the shape of my fiction brushes up against your home and feels like trespass—then I am truly sorry. I have tried to write with respect, but respect does not erase the fact that these are living places, and that a name on a page can carry weight.</p>
<p data-pid="p003">I grew up far from the coalfields. In 1984–85 I was in Sweden, and yet the miners’ strike reached me anyway. It travelled through radio reports and newspaper photographs, through the tone of adult conversations, through the sense that something was being decided—publicly, brutally—about what kind of society people would be allowed to build.</p>
<p data-pid="p004">Even from a distance, it was impossible not to feel the human scale of it: communities holding together under pressure, families reorganising their whole lives around solidarity, and the sharp line that forms when power chooses to treat neighbours as enemies.</p>
<p data-pid="p005">This book is my attempt to honour what that period still asks of us.</p>
<p data-pid="p006">Not in slogans, but in the texture of it: the meetings that run late, the cups of tea gone cold, the small humiliations and the private courage, the infrastructure of care that doesn’t make the headlines but makes survival possible.</p>
<p data-pid="p007">I wanted to write a story that shows what we can do—and what we can achieve—if we come together and decide that it is worth standing on the good side. The side where we stop looking at each other as enemies within anything, and start seeing each other as human beings: people who should look after one another, and help.</p>
