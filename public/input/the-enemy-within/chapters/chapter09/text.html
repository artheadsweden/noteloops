<p data-pid="p001">If you had told me, the night we watched Live Aid in that heaving Soho pub, that three months later I would be arguing about damp with a man called Terry in a draughty little office at the front of a soot-stained warehouse in East London, I would have laughed in your face.</p>
<p data-pid="p002">But there we were.</p>
<p data-pid="p003">Riz sat on the radiator in the corner with a stack of flyers on his lap, quiet but alert, as if he could spot the trap clauses before Charlotte did.</p>
<p data-pid="p004">‘The roof is sound,’ Terry kept saying, stabbing his biro at the ceiling tiles as if that proved anything. ‘It is just cosmetic. Bit of water staining.’</p>
<p data-pid="p005">I glanced at Shell. Arms folded, good coat buttoned to the throat, scarf tucked in. Her fringe was stuck to her forehead with sweat from the journey across town. She did not bother looking at the ceiling.</p>
<p data-pid="p006">The coat pulled a little where it had not needed to in July.</p>
<p data-pid="p007">‘Floor is not cosmetic,’ she said. ‘You could lose a bairn down some of those gaps.’</p>
<p data-pid="p008">Terry pulled a face like she was being unreasonable. He looked like every small landlord I had ever met: cheap suit, gold chain, fingernails too clean for anyone who claimed to be “hands-on”.</p>
<p data-pid="p009">‘You said you wanted somewhere cheap,’ he said. ‘Well, this is cheap. You are not getting the Barbican for this money, love.’</p>
<p data-pid="p010">I felt Shell's shoulders go tight beside me. I stepped in before she told him where to stick the Barbican.</p>
<p data-pid="p011">‘We are not saying no,’ I said. ‘We just cannot sign anything till our, er…’</p>
<p data-pid="p012">I glanced at Charlotte, perched on the windowsill behind us with a notebook on her knee. Jeans, battered boots, hair scraped up, but she still looked like she belonged in a different film to Terry and his biro. Her pen hovered like she was taking minutes at some committee we had not been invited to.</p>
<p data-pid="p013">‘…till our adviser has looked it over,’ I finished.</p>
<p data-pid="p014">Terry's eyes flicked to her. You could see him re-calibrating.</p>
<p data-pid="p015">‘Your adviser,’ he repeated.</p>
<p data-pid="p016">Charlotte gave him a small, polite smile that was somehow more devastating than Shell's full scowl.</p>
<p data-pid="p017">‘We just need to make sure the repairing obligations are proportionate,’ she said lightly. ‘Given the current state of the premises.’</p>
<p data-pid="p018">‘The what?’ he said.</p>
<p data-pid="p019">‘Who fixes what,’ she said. ‘Given…’ She gestured at the air, at everything.</p>
<p data-pid="p020">We had already been through the building once that morning. Old light-industrial unit at the end of a row of terraces, brick soot-blackened, windows patched with plywood and tape. Inside, it smelled of damp plaster, old oil, pigeon droppings and something sweet and rotten I tried not to name. The ground floor was one big rectangle with a row of metal pillars, concrete cracked like dried river mud. A half-finished mezzanine jutted at one end, a spiderweb of bare joists. A little room off to the side could, if you squinted, pass for an office.</p>
<p data-pid="p021">Shell had taken one look and said, ‘This is it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p022">I had seen it too – stage where the loading bay was, crowd under the beams, walls painted, sound bouncing back off brick. Tables for meetings, chairs in circles, kettles and tea urns and a crèche corner. A furnace, she had said back in July. A place where we could make our own heat, not just stand outside someone else's fire.</p>
<p data-pid="p023">Terry saw something else: a way to rinse a handful of idealists for the privilege of stopping the roof caving in on his insurance.</p>
<p data-pid="p024">‘Look,’ he said now, spreading his hands. ‘I am giving you a good deal because it is not exactly Mayfair, is it. Six months, rolling, minimal deposit. You said you are a… what is it… arts charity?’</p>
<p data-pid="p025">I could feel Shell physically bristle. We had spent a whole evening arguing about what we were so Charlotte could draft something plausible enough for an estate agent. Community arts and education project was where we landed, somewhere between truth and what gets you in the door.</p>
<p data-pid="p026">‘We work with communities affected by the strike,’ Charlotte said smoothly. ‘Music, training, legal support. That sort of thing.’</p>
<p data-pid="p027">Terry looked at me, not at her. ‘And you are in a band, yeah?’</p>
<p data-pid="p028">‘Coalface,’ I said. ‘We do benefit gigs. This would be rehearsal space, recording, workshops…’</p>
<p data-pid="p029">‘And a drop-in,’ Shell cut in. ‘And a place to get a cup of tea where no one will be trying to sell you owt. And a crèche. And a kitchen.’</p>
<p data-pid="p030">Terry's eyes flicked back to Charlotte. She inclined her head like she was noting it in a file.</p>
<p data-pid="p031">‘You do understand,’ he said carefully, ‘that if you start serving food you are in a different regulatory category?’</p>
<p data-pid="p032">He said regulatory like he was proud he knew the word. Shell gave him a look that would strip paint.</p>
<p data-pid="p033">‘We will worry about that bit,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p034">We ended up with a compromise hammered out over cold instant coffee in paper cups. Six months at a rent that made Shell blanch and Charlotte say, quietly, that it was not bad for Zone 2. A clause about repairs that Charlotte insisted on rewriting in biro on the spot while Terry sighed and tapped his watch. A promise that we would not “cause nuisance to neighbours”, which we all silently agreed meant we would not get caught.</p>
<p data-pid="p035">By the time we stepped back onto the street, the sky was the flat, featureless grey London excels at. A bus roared past, spraying dirty water. Shell took the folded lease from Charlotte like it was a live thing.</p>
<p data-pid="p036">‘You sure we are not walking into a trap?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p037">Charlotte tucked hair behind her ear.</p>
<p data-pid="p038">‘Every contract is a trap,’ she said. ‘This one has just got fewer teeth than most.’</p>
<p data-pid="p039">Shell snorted, unwillingly amused.</p>
<p data-pid="p040">‘We could have squatted it,’ I said, watching an old woman shuffle by with shopping bags in both hands. ‘Like the last place.’</p>
<p data-pid="p041">‘And been out on our arses the minute anyone noticed,’ Shell said. ‘This time I want them to have to go through the courts to get rid of us.’</p>
<p data-pid="p042">She lifted the papers a little.</p>
<p data-pid="p043">'Paper is a weapon too, Danny,' she said. 'They have been using it on us long enough.'</p>
<p data-pid="p044">Charlotte looked at her with that tilted, intent expression she got when someone said something that did not quite fit the picture in her head.</p>
<p data-pid="p045">‘You should have been a lawyer,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p046">Shell laughed so sharply a passer-by turned.</p>
<p data-pid="p047">‘Aye. Cannot you just see me in a wig.’</p>
<p data-pid="p048">‘You would be terrifying,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p049">She grinned. ‘Exactly.’</p>
<p data-pid="p050">*</p>
<p data-pid="p051">The first time we opened the padlock on the shutter with our own key, it felt faintly illegal even though it was not. The corrugated metal rattled as we hauled it up, daylight spilling in under the edge in a long white strip that widened and widened, revealing the inside like a stage being slowly lit.</p>
<p data-pid="p052">The air was cold enough to see your breath. Pigeons flapped up, wings beating dust into little storms. Old tyre marks scored the floor. A rusted metal shelving unit clung to one wall, laden with chipped plastic crates. A broken swivel chair sat in the middle like a sad throne.</p>
<p data-pid="p053">‘Beautiful,’ I said, deadpan.</p>
<p data-pid="p054">Shell and Charlotte stood side by side, hands in pockets, looking out at the space like they were seeing a different building.</p>
<p data-pid="p055">‘It will be,’ Shell said.</p>
<p data-pid="p056">Charlotte nodded. ‘We will need the electrics checked. There is probably asbestos in that insulation. And you should definitely get rid of that chair.’</p>
<p data-pid="p057">She sounded brisk, almost businesslike, but then she stepped into the middle and spun once on her heel, testing the echo, and I saw the grin break through.</p>
<p data-pid="p058">‘Listen,’ she said. ‘It sounds like possibility.’</p>
<p data-pid="p059">*</p>
<p data-pid="p060">We worked out early that The Furnace – we called it that before the first coat of paint – would eat every spare hour. Days were for gigs, temp jobs, Shell's endless meetings in draughty halls and the odd appointment she did not put on the rota. Nights and weekends were for scraping, painting, wiring, cleaning.</p>
<p data-pid="p061">We started with the roof. Terry was right that the main structure was sound, but there were leaks at every gutter and a patch in the far corner where you could see daylight through broken tiles. Shell climbed the ladder like she had been working at heights all her life, even though I could see the extra care in how she placed her foot on each rung. I trailed after, trying not to look down at the cracked concrete.</p>
<p data-pid="p062">From up there the city stretched in all directions – cranes, chimney stacks, the bruise-coloured ribbon of the river a few streets over. Traffic was a constant wash somewhere beneath. We worked in gloves stiff with cold, passing tarred felt and buckets of bitumen back and forth.</p>
<p data-pid="p063">‘You could have married a nice lad who works in an office,’ I said, prising up a strip of rotten felt.</p>
<p data-pid="p064">Shell snorted. ‘Eddie works in an office now. Foreman. Fills in forms and shouts at lads instead of freezing his knackers off at the face. Says it is promotion.’</p>
<p data-pid="p065">‘And you?’</p>
<p data-pid="p066">She wiped her forehead with her wrist, leaving a black smear.</p>
<p data-pid="p067">‘And me what?’</p>
<p data-pid="p068">‘How does that feel, him moving up while you are clambering about on strange roofs in London?’</p>
<p data-pid="p069">She went quiet, looking over towards the terrace opposite. In one window, a kid pressed his face to the glass, watching us like a stunt show.</p>
<p data-pid="p070">‘Feels like we are still married on paper,’ she said eventually, ‘still care about each other, still share Lily – but we stopped being that kind of couple a while back. We just have not said it out loud where anyone else can hear.’</p>
<p data-pid="p071">I did not know what to say, so I handed her another strip of felt.</p>
<p data-pid="p072">*</p>
<p data-pid="p073">The electrics were another matter. The first time we flicked the ancient metal switch by the door, there was a crack, a smell of scorched dust and nothing else. I voted for calling an actual electrician. Shell said we could not afford it.</p>
<p data-pid="p074">That was when Imran appeared.</p>
<p data-pid="p075">Strictly speaking he did not appear; he was dragged in by Alex, who turned up one Saturday with paint flecks on his glasses and a man in a work jacket in tow.</p>
<p data-pid="p076">‘This is Imran,’ Alex announced, like he was introducing a new band member rather than a stocky bloke with a toolbox. ‘He can make dead things live again.’</p>
<p data-pid="p077">Imran rolled his eyes. ‘Only if they were meant to be alive in the first place.’</p>
<p data-pid="p078">He was East End born and bred, parents from Lahore, accent stretched between Stepney and somewhere further out. He worked, he told us, ‘in communications’ – which turned out to be installing phone lines and fixing exchange boxes for BT.</p>
<p data-pid="p079">‘You are not meant to be doing this,’ he said cheerfully, crouching to peer into the fuse box. ‘But then I am not meant to be nicking this much cable, so we will call it even.’</p>
<p data-pid="p080">Shell eyed him.</p>
<p data-pid="p081">‘You sure you know what you are doing?’</p>
<p data-pid="p082">He grinned without turning.</p>
<p data-pid="p083">‘Do you want it safe or legal?’ he said. ‘Because you cannot have both on your budget.’</p>
<p data-pid="p084">Within an hour he had the place mapped in his head: where the cables ran, what needed replacing, which ancient porcelain fittings could be coaxed back to life and which were death sentences. He talked as he worked, a BT test handset clipped to a pair of wires he had temporarily bridged in from next door, calling in favours from mates in other depots.</p>
<p data-pid="p085">‘We will get you a line in here as well,’ he said. ‘Proper one. Not just payphones and shouting out of windows. One line, one list – you can turn twenty people into two hundred. Trust me.’</p>
<p data-pid="p086">I watched his hands move, turning chaos into something purposeful. It was like watching Shell with a rota, or Charlotte with a draft contract. Different tools, same brain.</p>
<p data-pid="p087">‘What is the list?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p088">He glanced up.</p>
<p data-pid="p089">‘Whatever you need it to be. People who came to last week's gig. People who will support your court case. People who will be on a coach when you say 'coach'. You start small and, if you are clever, it gets out of hand.’</p>
<p data-pid="p090">I looked around at bare walls, paint tins, ladders. Out of hand sounded like exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p data-pid="p091">*</p>
<p data-pid="p092">The carpenter arrived a week later.</p>
<p data-pid="p093">His name was Ben. He looked permanently dusted in fine sawdust, hair and beard trimmed close, quiet hands that knew their way round timber. He came recommended by a woman from one of Shell's London committees who owed her a favour.</p>
<p data-pid="p094">‘I cannot pay you much,’ Shell said straight off, when he came to look at the half-built mezzanine. ‘If we ever make owt it will go back into the place.’</p>
<p data-pid="p095">Ben ran a hand over the supporting beam, checking for rot.</p>
<p data-pid="p096">‘I am not doing it for the money,’ he said. ‘Cannot stand bad joinery. Whoever started this did not know what they were doing.’</p>
<p data-pid="p097">He looked at her properly then, and something eased in his face.</p>
<p data-pid="p098">‘Besides,’ he said, ‘I like the idea of building a stage more than another bloody kitchen extension in Muswell Hill.’</p>
<p data-pid="p099">He started turning up every evening after his day job, thermos under one arm, radio under the other. Shell brought him tea and digestives in the office while they pored over rough sketches – where to put the stair, how wide the balcony should be, how low they could hang the front and still get a drum kit underneath.</p>
<p data-pid="p100">‘You will want a decent rail,’ he said, standing on bare joists, arms spread. ‘If you lot are going to be leaning over yelling into microphones, I would rather you did not break your necks.’</p>
<p data-pid="p101">‘We do not yell,’ I said. ‘We project.’</p>
<p data-pid="p102">‘You yell,’ Shell said. ‘That is why they like you.’</p>
<p data-pid="p103">Some nights I came in late from a gig or temp shift and found them still there, sawdust in the air, an old strip light casting everything in chalky blue. They would be sat on the edge of the platform, boots swinging, talking in low voices between knocks and scrapes. A different ease had started to settle between them – the kind that meant you could hand someone a screwdriver without asking and they would know which one you needed.</p>
<p data-pid="p104">I told myself the twist in my chest was worry – for what people would say back home, for how complicated things already were – but then I would see how Shell stood a bit straighter when Ben was in the room, and I would think: maybe people get to decide what their own life looks like, even when it does not fit neat patterns.</p>
<p data-pid="p105">‘Do not start,’ she said when I ventured something half-formed about Eddie on the phone. ‘He gets his nights with his mates and his own life back home. I am allowed mine down here. We are still married, still look after Lily together – but the rest of it has not been true for a while. We both know it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p106">And I thought, not for the first time, that the revolution we were building was not just about bills and ballots. It was about who got to feel entitled to be in a room after dark with people who saw them.</p>
<p data-pid="p107">*</p>
<p data-pid="p108">During the days, when the lads were at work and Shell was at meetings, I was often at the unit alone. I scraped ancient paint off window frames until my arm ached. I swept up glass and mouse droppings into piles that kept reappearing, like the building was growing new filth when my back was turned.</p>
<p data-pid="p109">Sometimes local kids wandered in, curious. The first week we had the door open, a gang of them turned up – skinny boys in school jumpers, a couple of girls in too-big coats – and planted themselves just inside the threshold, staring.</p>
<p data-pid="p110">‘You lot moving in?’ one of them asked, hands deep in his pockets like he was protecting something valuable.</p>
<p data-pid="p111">‘Depends what you mean by moving,’ I said. ‘We are going to be doing music and meetings and that. Maybe a youth club if we can stop it falling down.’</p>
<p data-pid="p112">A girl with plaits, maybe ten, pointed at the half-finished mezzanine.</p>
<p data-pid="p113">‘That a stage?’</p>
<p data-pid="p114">‘It will be.’</p>
<p data-pid="p115">She nodded, satisfied. ‘My uncle had a band once. They got on the telly.’</p>
<p data-pid="p116">The others looked at her with new respect. I could not tell if it was true and decided it did not matter.</p>
<p data-pid="p117">We gave them jobs: carrying rubble to the skip, rolling paint onto the lower walls, fishing ancient screws out of tins and sorting them into piles. They took to it like it was the best game they had ever been offered.</p>
<p data-pid="p118">Imran turned up one afternoon with a cardboard box under his arm.</p>
<p data-pid="p119">‘Got something for your new stewards,’ he said, setting it down and flipping the flaps back.</p>
<p data-pid="p120">Inside lay four walkie-talkies, battered but serviceable, each with a strip of tape round the aerial where someone had written BT TEST in faded marker.</p>
<p data-pid="p121">‘Borrowed these from work permanently,’ he said. ‘Figured you are going to need a way to talk once this place is full.’</p>
<p data-pid="p122">The kids were on him before I could blink.</p>
<p data-pid="p123">‘Can we try them?’</p>
<p data-pid="p124">‘What is your call sign?’</p>
<p data-pid="p125">‘Do they work from upstairs?’</p>
<p data-pid="p126">Imran handed them out with priestly solemnity.</p>
<p data-pid="p127">‘You can help me test them,’ he said. ‘But they stay here. No taking them home to play spies in the tower block. Got it?’</p>
<p data-pid="p128">They nodded, eyes huge.</p>
<p data-pid="p129">For the next hour the space filled with crackly voices, bursts of laughter, thumps of feet on the stairs as they raced up and down, reporting imaginary emergencies.</p>
<p data-pid="p130">‘Base, this is Door,’ one boy said, chest puffed out by the entrance. ‘There are two mums and a buggy approaching, over.’</p>
<p data-pid="p131">‘Door, this is Kitchen,’ a girl replied from the far corner where the sink would be. ‘Offer them a cuppa, over.’</p>
<p data-pid="p132">It was ridiculous and lovely and, for a moment, I could see it – queues at the door, stewards in hi-vis we had not bought yet, the feel of this bare concrete covered in people who did not know they needed a place like this until it existed.</p>
<p data-pid="p133">*</p>
<p data-pid="p134">We found the café by accident.</p>
<p data-pid="p135">Next street over, fading turquoise frontage, steamed-up windows, a sign so old the letters were almost worn away. From outside you saw tables crowded close, a counter with glass jars, a tiny television in the corner showing football.</p>
<p data-pid="p136">We only went in because Shell had hit the point where, if she did not get food, she would start eating plasterboard. That, and because the smell of paint and dust had started turning her stomach in a way she did not want to explain to blokes like Terry.</p>
<p data-pid="p137">The warmth hit first. Then the smell: fried plantain, coffee, spices I did not know the names of. A woman behind the counter looked up as we came in, wiping her hands on her apron.</p>
<p data-pid="p138">‘You lot from the warehouse,’ she said before we had opened our mouths.</p>
<p data-pid="p139">Shell froze. ‘What is it to you?’</p>
<p data-pid="p140">The woman laughed, big and easy.</p>
<p data-pid="p141">‘My youngest says there are people living with the pigeons now,’ she said. ‘I told him not to be rude, but I had to see.’</p>
<p data-pid="p142">We ended up at a table with plates of curry goat, rice and peas, fried dumplings that could solve most problems on their own. The woman introduced herself as Gloria. Her husband, David, came out from the kitchen to say hello, wiping sweat from his brow with a tea towel. Their eldest sat in the corner doing homework, pen moving in tight strokes.</p>
<p data-pid="p143">‘This place used to be busy,’ Gloria said, topping up our glasses with ginger beer. ‘Workshops on the estate, men coming in on break, mums after the school run. Now they close one factory after another and everyone has got no money and no time. You open something, it stays open six months, then it is gone.’</p>
<p data-pid="p144">She looked at Shell.</p>
<p data-pid="p145">‘You planning to stay?’</p>
<p data-pid="p146">Shell glanced at me, then back.</p>
<p data-pid="p147">‘That is the idea,’ she said. ‘We have had enough of things disappearing on us.’</p>
<p data-pid="p148">Gloria nodded once.</p>
<p data-pid="p149">‘Then you make sure you put your flyers in here,’ she said. ‘People might not go looking for you. They will come looking for my patties.’</p>
<p data-pid="p150">After that, the café became our unofficial office. We had meetings there when the warehouse was too cold to think. We borrowed their phone when ours died because Imran had “borrowed” a bit too much from the line to run to the new extension upstairs. Gloria slipped plates of food in front of us even when we insisted we could not afford it, saying she would rather feed troublemakers than tax inspectors.</p>
<p data-pid="p151">One January evening, when the wind outside felt like it was coming straight off the North Sea, we were crammed around a table at the back – me, Shell, Imran, Alex, two estate mums Shell had recruited from playgroup. A4 sheets were spread between us, scribbled lists and crude floor-plan diagrams.</p>
<p data-pid="p152">Shell sat carefully, coat unbuttoned despite the cold, one hand braced against her lower back and the other resting on the curve of her belly as if she could keep the whole project steady by touch alone. She had been “fine” for months in that way organisers are fine, all sharp edges and lists, but the baby was no longer something you could pretend was just tiredness.</p>
<p data-pid="p153">‘We will need chairs that stack,’ Debbie said. ‘So we can move them out the way for gigs. And somewhere for prams. Cannot have people tripping over pram wheels in the dark.’</p>
<p data-pid="p154">‘And a proper kettle that does not take half an hour,’ Lin added. ‘If you want people to stay for meetings you need tea in them before they change their mind.’</p>
<p data-pid="p155">Imran tapped the paper with his pen.</p>
<p data-pid="p156">‘And sockets,’ he said. ‘Here, here, here. You need to think about where the power flows, not just the bodies.’</p>
<p data-pid="p157">I sat back, watching them, and felt something shift.</p>
<p data-pid="p158">This was different to the early days. Back then it had been gigs that ended in shouting and someone punching a poster. This was quieter and, somehow, more dangerous. We were not just making noise now. We were drawing the shape of something that might outlast all of us.</p>
<p data-pid="p159">Gloria came over with a new pot of coffee balancing on one hip.</p>
<p data-pid="p160">‘You look serious,’ she said to me.</p>
<p data-pid="p161">‘Just thinking,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p162">‘Careful with that,’ she said. ‘Dangerous habit.’</p>
<p data-pid="p163">I smiled.</p>
<p data-pid="p164">‘We used to go into rooms and yell at people who already agreed with us,’ I said. ‘Now we are planning sockets.’</p>
<p data-pid="p165">She laughed.</p>
<p data-pid="p166">‘Revolution is ninety per cent sockets,’ she said. ‘Do not let anyone tell you different.’</p>
<p data-pid="p167">*</p>
<p data-pid="p168">Shell went back up north a few days after that meeting.</p>
<p data-pid="p169">She tried to make it sound like a practical decision – nearer her mam, nearer Eddie for Lily, a proper bed instead of a mattress in a half-finished office at the warehouse. But when she hugged me goodbye outside King’s Cross, she held on too long and I felt her shake once, like something inside her had finally admitted it was frightened.</p>
<p data-pid="p170">‘Do not do anything stupid while I am gone,’ she said into my shoulder.</p>
<p data-pid="p171">‘That is a big ask,’ I said, and tried to make it a joke.</p>
<p data-pid="p172">She pulled back and stared at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p173">‘I mean it, Danny,’ she said. ‘No heroics. No trying to prove you can carry the whole bloody building on your back because I am not here to tell you off.’</p>
<p data-pid="p174">‘All right,’ I said. ‘No heroics.’</p>
<p data-pid="p175">She snorted, because we both knew that was a lie we would try to honour anyway.</p>
<p data-pid="p176">For a week we did the work without her. We scraped and swept and swore, we chased kids out of the way of stray nails, we argued about paint shades and where the stage edge ought to sit. Ben kept showing up with his thermos, Imran kept turning chaos into circuits, and I kept thinking of Shell’s handwriting on paper like it was another kind of scaffolding.</p>
<p data-pid="p177">Then the phone rang.</p>
<p data-pid="p178">It was late, after midnight, the kind of time when London went quiet enough you could hear the building settle. The handset was one of Imran’s temporary miracles, clipped to a wire like a dare. I snatched it up before the second ring.</p>
<p data-pid="p179">‘Hello?’</p>
<p data-pid="p180">There was a pause and then a voice I did not recognise – brisk, tired, professional.</p>
<p data-pid="p181">‘Is this Daniel Ashcroft?’</p>
<p data-pid="p182">My stomach dropped at the sound of my full name.</p>
<p data-pid="p183">‘Aye,’ I said. ‘Who is this?’</p>
<p data-pid="p184">‘Barnsley District General,’ she said, and the words turned the air to ice. ‘Your friend Michelle has asked us to ring. She’s in labour. We’ve got a message for you about trains.’</p>
<p data-pid="p185">I was already scrabbling for paper, knocking over a tin of screws, fingers clumsy with panic. The only thing to hand was an old envelope with a council stamp on it. I flattened it on the desk with my palm.</p>
<p data-pid="p186">‘Go on,’ I said. My voice sounded wrong.</p>
<p data-pid="p187">She read numbers at me – times, platforms, the shape of a route I had taken often enough for gigs but never with this in my chest. I wrote them down in thick, shaking biro. A train time scribbled on the back of an envelope. Like it was just another errand.</p>
<p data-pid="p188">When I hung up, the room was too small. I stood there with the receiver still in my hand, listening to the dial tone, then to my own breath.</p>
<p data-pid="p189">Riz, sleeping on the floor with his coat as a pillow, blinked awake.</p>
<p data-pid="p190">‘What’s happened?’ he mumbled.</p>
<p data-pid="p191">‘Shell,’ I said. ‘It’s… it’s now.’</p>
<p data-pid="p192">He sat up so fast he smacked his head on the desk.</p>
<p data-pid="p193">Alex appeared in the doorway in his socks, hair standing up.</p>
<p data-pid="p194">‘You’re white,’ he said.</p>
<p data-pid="p195">‘Barnsley hospital,’ I said, and watched him understand.</p>
<p data-pid="p196">We moved like we were on a timetable we hadn’t rehearsed. Bag, coat, keys. Riz shoved a fiver into my hand and told me not to be a martyr about food. Alex insisted on coming to King’s Cross with me even though I told him it was daft and he told me to shut up.</p>
<p data-pid="p197">The station smelled of frying and diesel and last night’s rain. The departure board clicked over with indifferent calm. I kept touching the envelope in my pocket, as if the biro could smudge and make the whole thing untrue.</p>
<p data-pid="p198">On the train north I did not read. I did not sleep. I watched the dark press against the windows and tried not to imagine all the ways bodies can go wrong.</p>
<p data-pid="p199">By the time I got to Barnsley the sky had gone that pale washed-out colour it gets just before proper morning. The hospital corridors were lit too bright. Plastic chairs in rows. Signs telling you not to smoke. A vending machine humming like an insect.</p>
<p data-pid="p200">Eddie was there, sitting forward with his elbows on his knees like he was about to go underground. He stood when he saw me, face doing something I couldn’t read.</p>
<p data-pid="p201">‘All right?’ I said, because I had no better words.</p>
<p data-pid="p202">‘Aye,’ he said, and his voice cracked on the vowel. ‘She’s… she’s tough. You know that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p203">Lily was asleep with her head on his jacket, thumb in her mouth, curls stuck to her cheek. Seeing her there – not on a picket line, not at a meeting, but in a hospital waiting room – made me want to punch something.</p>
<p data-pid="p204">Hours passed in a blur of bad coffee and footsteps and doors that opened and closed. At some point a midwife with kind eyes said my name and nodded us through.</p>
<p data-pid="p205">Shell looked wrecked and incandescent at the same time. Hair plastered to her forehead, hospital gown twisted, a fist clenched in the sheet like she was holding on to the world by fabric.</p>
<p data-pid="p206">When she saw me, she tried to smile and ended up swearing.</p>
<p data-pid="p207">‘Took you long enough,’ she rasped.</p>
<p data-pid="p208">‘You rang at midnight,’ I said, and my throat tightened so hard the words came out thin.</p>
<p data-pid="p209">‘That’s no excuse,’ she said, and then a sound tore out of her that wasn’t a joke at all.</p>
<p data-pid="p210">I will not pretend I was brave. I held her hand and tried not to shake. Eddie stood on the other side, face grey, murmuring nonsense. A midwife told Shell to breathe and Shell told the midwife where she could put her breathing exercises.</p>
<p data-pid="p211">And then – sometime after a long stretch where time stopped behaving like time – there was a cry.</p>
<p data-pid="p212">Small, furious, alive.</p>
<p data-pid="p213">The room shifted. Air came back into my lungs like it had been withheld on purpose. Shell went slack against the pillow, blinking in stunned disbelief.</p>
<p data-pid="p214">They laid him on her chest and he wriggled like he was offended by the whole arrangement.</p>
<p data-pid="p215">‘Hello,’ Shell whispered, and her voice cracked in a way I had never heard. ‘Hello, love.’</p>
<p data-pid="p216">Eddie made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been a sob.</p>
<p data-pid="p217">Shell looked at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p218">‘We did it,’ she said, fierce through tears. ‘Tell them down there we did it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p219">‘Aye,’ I said. ‘We did it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p220">She kissed the baby’s head, then glared at me as if she had remembered something important.</p>
<p data-pid="p221">‘Lucas,’ she said suddenly. ‘We’re calling him Lucas. Don’t let anyone argue. I am not having some committee meeting about it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p222">I laughed and the sound came out broken.</p>
<p data-pid="p223">‘No committees,’ I promised.</p>
<p data-pid="p224">On the way back south, the envelope with the train time stayed in my pocket, creased now, damp from my sweat. I kept thinking about how absurd it was – that you could build a life on scribbles and luck and a woman who refused to lie down when the world told her to.</p>
<p data-pid="p225">*</p>
<p data-pid="p226">By the first week of February the space had changed so much it hardly felt like the same building.</p>
<p data-pid="p227">Walls painted off-white, the lower halves dark to hide the scuffs we knew were coming. The mezzanine finished, solid underfoot, with a rough bannister you could lean on without getting splinters. The stage at the far end barely more than pallets and ply, but ours. The office corner had a door that closed, a second-hand filing cabinet, a battered desk with a typewriter.</p>
<p data-pid="p228">On top of the cabinet sat a cardboard box with SUMMONS, LEAFLETS, PRESS CLIPPINGS written across the side in Shell's careful hand.</p>
<p data-pid="p229">‘We are keeping all of it,’ she said, dropping another folded sheet in one afternoon – a letter from a housing officer threatening eviction for arrears no one could cover. ‘Every letter, every poster, every nasty little note. One day we will need to show someone what they did.’</p>
<p data-pid="p230">‘We have not even opened,’ I said. ‘Bit early to be starting an archive.’</p>
<p data-pid="p231">She looked at me like I had missed something obvious.</p>
<p data-pid="p232">‘We have been living inside their bloody archive for years,’ she said. ‘Court records, newspaper lies, police reports. This is ours.’</p>
<p data-pid="p233">I looked at the scuffed cardboard, the neat stack inside. It did not seem like much – scraps, really. Then I pictured some kid like Keira, forty years on, tapping a recorder on a table, and felt a shiver at the back of my neck.</p>
<p data-pid="p234">‘Fine,’ I said. ‘But when the room fills, I am not sleeping next to that box. Gives me the creeps.’</p>
<p data-pid="p235">She grinned.</p>
<p data-pid="p236">‘You will be grateful for it when some bastard magistrate says 'prove it',’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p237">*</p>
<p data-pid="p238">The first unofficial gathering was on a Sunday in the first week of February.</p>
<p data-pid="p239">We did not call it an opening; that felt like tempting fate. We called it “a few people coming round to see the place”. Riz and Gloria between them produced enough stew and patties to feed an army. Someone brought a bag of plastic beakers and a catering-sized jar of instant coffee. Someone else brought a pack of nappies like it was a contribution to the bar.</p>
<p data-pid="p240">By two o'clock there were already more people than I had dared hope: friends from Camden, the miners' support lot, kids from the street, mums with babies on hips, a couple of older union men who stood by the wall, arms folded, wary but interested.</p>
<p data-pid="p241">Imran had strung coloured fairy lights across the beams and wired a temporary PA – nothing fancy, just enough that, if you stood in the doorway, you could not pretend nothing was happening inside. The concrete floor was still bare, but mismatched chairs dotted around, and a few old sofas someone had found in a skip and covered with blankets.</p>
<p data-pid="p242">Charlotte arrived late, as always, bringing a gust of cold air. She had two women with her I did not recognise, both in neat coats and scarves, one with a camera, the other with a reporter's notebook. Bridges, I thought automatically. Satisfaction flickered that they were here, in this part of town, not at some West End gallery.</p>
<p data-pid="p243">‘You made it,’ I said, taking her coat.</p>
<p data-pid="p244">She looked round, eyes wide.</p>
<p data-pid="p245">‘You did this,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p246">‘We did this,’ I said. ‘You filled in the bits on the form where we did not know what we were signing.’</p>
<p data-pid="p247">She laughed.</p>
<p data-pid="p248">‘I underlined the trapdoors,’ she said. ‘You are the ones who decided to walk across.’</p>
<p data-pid="p249">Shell appeared at my elbow with Lucas bundled against her chest, his face a small red frown above the blanket.</p>
<p data-pid="p250">‘Get a bowl in your hand if you are near the kitchen,’ she said. ‘No one gets away without eating. And if anyone asks if he is “good as gold”, tell them he is a newborn, not a sovereign.’</p>
<p data-pid="p251">Charlotte took the stew with both hands.</p>
<p data-pid="p252">‘Bossy,’ she said, admiring.</p>
<p data-pid="p253">‘Organised,’ I said. ‘There is a difference.’</p>
<p data-pid="p254">People kept drifting over to look at Lucas and then catching themselves, as if they weren’t sure they were allowed to be soft in a building full of politics. Shell handled it the way she handled everything: she made it part of the plan. She put him in Debbie’s arms for five minutes so she could shout instructions across the hall. She let Gloria kiss his forehead. She watched Imran hover like he wanted to build the baby a fuse box.</p>
<p data-pid="p255">At some point someone – Lin, I think – banged a spoon against a mug and said, ‘Right. Welcome then.’</p>
<p data-pid="p256">We raised plastic beakers of tea and cheap lager and ginger beer.</p>
<p data-pid="p257">‘To Lucas,’ Lin said, eyes bright.</p>
<p data-pid="p258">‘To Shell,’ Gloria corrected.</p>
<p data-pid="p259">‘To The Furnace,’ Imran added, grinning.</p>
<p data-pid="p260">I watched the two of them talk – Shell in her second-hand jumper, hair pinned any old way; Charlotte in a jumper that probably cost more than our monthly rent but with sleeves pushed up, unbothered about paint. Once I would have tried to keep those worlds apart. Now I could not imagine this place existing without both.</p>
<p data-pid="p261">Later, someone produced a guitar. I ended up on the stage almost by accident, Imran fiddling with the makeshift PA while the kids with walkie-talkies patrolled the edges, solemn as if guarding a royal visit.</p>
<p data-pid="p262">‘You going to sing us the one about the Cabinet Office again?’ one of the estate mums called. ‘My Lin has been humming it all week.’</p>
<p data-pid="p263">I grimaced.</p>
<p data-pid="p264">‘We are working on new ones,’ I said. ‘I promise.’</p>
<p data-pid="p265">But when I started playing, my hands went to the familiar shapes. Songs about picket lines and buses that did not come and policemen who pushed us into ditches. Songs scribbled in cramped bedrooms when I thought we were fighting one battle. They sounded different here, in a stripped-out warehouse with kids' drawings taped in one corner and a box of summons forming in the office.</p>
<p data-pid="p266">Between songs I talked. Not the polished patter we had for benefit gigs, but something else – slower, more practical. What we wanted this place to be. Why we needed rotas, childcare, drop-ins. How we were going to get words into the hands of people who never picked up a political pamphlet but would read something if it was shoved into their shopping bag with a flyer for cheap tea.</p>
<p data-pid="p267">I could feel them listening differently. Not as an audience, but as co-conspirators.</p>
<p data-pid="p268">When I stepped down, Shell was by the office door, arms folded, eyebrows raised.</p>
<p data-pid="p269">‘You enjoyed that,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p270">‘You did not?’</p>
<p data-pid="p271">She hesitated, then shook her head.</p>
<p data-pid="p272">‘I did,’ she said. ‘I just…’</p>
<p data-pid="p273">She looked out at the room. Debbie sorting a squabble over whose turn it was with the walkie-talkies. Gloria clearing plates. An older union man talking to Charlotte's journalist friend, stabbing the air for emphasis.</p>
<p data-pid="p274">‘I thought we were finished after the march back to work,’ she said quietly. ‘Thought that was it. Then I came down here and you lot were still making a racket and I thought, right, maybe there is another way. But this…’</p>
<p data-pid="p275">She gestured at walls, rafters, the cobbled-together miracle of it.</p>
<p data-pid="p276">‘This feels like we are not just shouting any more,’ she said. ‘Feels like we are building something that will not blow away next time she opens her gob.’</p>
<p data-pid="p277">I looked at her, at the smear of stew on her sleeve, the tiredness around her eyes that had not quite been erased by the day.</p>
<p data-pid="p278">‘We would not have done it without you,’ I said. ‘Left to me and Alex we would still be arguing about what colour to paint the stage.’</p>
<p data-pid="p279">She snorted.</p>
<p data-pid="p280">‘Red,’ she said. ‘Obviously.’</p>
<p data-pid="p281">‘Black,’ I said. ‘Shows less dirt.’</p>
<p data-pid="p282">‘See?’ she said. ‘This is why someone sensible had to come and take charge.’</p>
<p data-pid="p283">There was warmth in her tone, but something still nudged.</p>
<p data-pid="p284">‘I am not in charge?’ I said, half-joking.</p>
<p data-pid="p285">She gave me a look that was part affection, part exasperation, part something else.</p>
<p data-pid="p286">‘You are the one with the guitar and the big mouth, Ashcroft,’ she said. ‘You point at the sky and shout. People need that. But when it comes to who remembers to buy loo roll and who knows which form you send to the council so they do not shut you down for having too many chairs, that is not you, is it?’</p>
<p data-pid="p287">I opened my mouth to protest, then shut it again. She was right, and I could feel it like a bruise.</p>
<p data-pid="p288">‘So what does that make you?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p289">She looked out at the room again – kids with walkie-talkies, Imran showing someone how to plug a cable in without a shock, Charlotte leaning against a pillar talking to Gloria, hands moving as she tried to explain something about media coverage.</p>
<p data-pid="p290">‘It makes me the one who keeps the fire going,’ she said. ‘You can be the bloke who runs outside and tells everyone to come warm their hands. That is fine. Just do not forget who is putting coal in.’</p>
<p data-pid="p291">I followed her gaze and, suddenly, I saw it her way: the invisible network of lists and letters and rotas, the way all these people were connected not just by songs and slogans but by someone making sure there was tea and chairs and a phone that worked.</p>
<p data-pid="p292">‘All right,’ I said. ‘You are organiser, I am front man. We will put it on the letterhead.’</p>
<p data-pid="p293">She laughed.</p>
<p data-pid="p294">‘You can have your name in big letters later when you are giving evidence to some inquiry,’ she said. ‘For now, just remember to turn the lights off when you are last out.’</p>
<p data-pid="p295">‘That is Imran's department now,’ I said, but I nodded, because I knew she meant more than electricity.</p>
<p data-pid="p296">*</p>
<p data-pid="p297">When everyone had gone and the place was finally quiet, we stood in the middle of the floor – me, Shell, Imran, Alex, Charlotte – and turned in a slow circle, taking it in.</p>
<p data-pid="p298">Cups on every flat surface, paint chips underfoot, a rogue balloon bobbing near the ceiling. The air smelled of stew and sweat and cheap coffee and damp plaster and something else, something new that did not have a word yet.</p>
<p data-pid="p299">‘So,’ Imran said, shoving his hands in his pockets. ‘You lot still think this is just a rehearsal room?’</p>
<p data-pid="p300">‘It is an infrastructure project,’ Charlotte said.</p>
<p data-pid="p301">‘It is a community centre,’ Alex said, yawning.</p>
<p data-pid="p302">Shell looked at the cardboard box on the filing cabinet.</p>
<p data-pid="p303">‘It is evidence,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p304">I looked at the stage, the fairy lights, the cables snaking like roots across the floor, and thought of Live Aid on the pub telly, of cameras and power and who gets to tell the story.</p>
<p data-pid="p305">‘It is a fuse box,’ I said. ‘We have just wired it up to things they do not know about yet.’</p>
<p data-pid="p306">They all looked at me. For once, no one laughed.</p>
<p data-pid="p307">‘Then we had better make sure they cannot just flick it off at the wall,’ Shell said.</p>
<p data-pid="p308">She reached over, turned out the lights herself, and we walked out together into the East London night, locking the shutter behind us.</p></div>
