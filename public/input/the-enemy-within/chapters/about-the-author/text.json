    "text": "Joakim Wassberg writes historically grounded fiction with a bias towards lived detail: the small routines, the local language, the awkward jokes, the practical problems, the private compromises. His work is driven by research, first-hand testimony, and an interest in how ordinary people experience events that later get flattened into headlines."

    "text": "Alongside fiction, he builds tools and workflows for long-form creative projects, and he is drawn to the overlap between story, memory, and technology: how we record what happened, how we retell it, and how those retellings shape what comes next."
