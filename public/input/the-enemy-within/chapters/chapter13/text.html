<div class="chapter" data-chapter-id="chapter13"><h1>Chapter Thirteen – December 1987 – London / Oxfordshire – Glass Saints and Country House</h1>
<p data-pid="p001">It started with men in suits on the telly pretending the world was suddenly safe.</p>
<p data-pid="p002">The kitchen at The Furnace smelled of curry, instant coffee and photocopier toner from the room down the hall. Someone had left the little portable TV propped on a crate, aerial crooked, picture washed-out. Reagan and Gorbachev shook hands in Washington, flags behind them, translators hovering like chaperones.</p>
<p data-pid="p003">‘See?’ Riz said, leaning back against the counter with a mug between his hands. ‘We have done our job. No more nuclear war. Call it off. Go home.’</p>
<p data-pid="p004">‘World peace brought to you by two blokes who would sell their own nans,’ Shell said, flicking through a pile of flyers with CLAUSE 28 in heavy type across the top. ‘I will start knitting them a banner.’</p>
<p data-pid="p005">On screen, the newsreader used that light, hopeful tone they kept for weddings and royal babies. Historic step. Safer Europe. They cut to Greenham Common, where a woman with a weathered face and a CND badge was crying as she spoke, saying it had all been worth it.</p>
<p data-pid="p006">I should have felt relief. I had grown up with sirens tested and the idea that one day we would all go up in a white flash that made the strike and the dole and everything else feel small. Instead I found myself watching mouths, not words. The way the anchors leaned in when they mentioned Kremlin hardliners, how they relaxed when they turned to house prices.</p>
<p data-pid="p007">‘It is all theatre,’ I said. ‘They are not scared of the missiles. They are scared of headlines.’</p>
<p data-pid="p008">‘Which is exactly why you, Mister Long Game, need to be on this train.’</p>
<p data-pid="p009">Shell slapped an envelope in front of me. My name was on it in neat, looping ink. A London address I recognised from the back of a Christmas card: Haversham House, some Belgravia street that sounded like it came with doormen in the bricks. Inside, on paper thick enough to make my fingers feel grubby, was the real destination.</p>
<p data-pid="p010">Deerbrook Hall, Oxfordshire.</p>
<p data-pid="p011">‘You are sure this is not a trap?’ I said, even as my thumb ran over the embossed crest at the top – small shield, crossed keys, Latin motto that might as well have said <em>remember your place</em>.</p>
<p data-pid="p012">‘If it is, it is a very pretty one,’ Shell said. ‘Free food, central heating and a chance to poke a Tory in his natural habitat. I am not missing that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p013">Charlotte had written the letter but I could hear her voice. Dad wants to hear what you are up to. He has finally listened to the EP. There is a sort of listening thing at the house tonight. Come, if you can bear it. Bring Shell if you like. I would feel better with you both there.</p>
<p data-pid="p014">‘Listening thing,’ I muttered. ‘Posh code for we sit in a drawing room and make faces at your little record.’</p>
<p data-pid="p015">‘You wanted the posh kids,’ Shell said. ‘Well, this is their dad. The original model. If you are serious about getting inside their heads, you go and have dinner with one.’</p>
<p data-pid="p016">I thought of the woman at Greenham on the screen, years of her life camped in the rain outside bases they had promised were essential, only to call them surplus once the photo opportunities lined up. I thought of the tapes still going out from our little post room, jiffy bags addressed in Shell's tidy capitals, stories pressed into plastic and ferried through letterboxes we would never see.</p>
<p data-pid="p017">‘What if I make an idiot of myself?’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p018">‘You will,’ Shell said. ‘That is a given. But you will not be alone. I will tell you which fork to use.’</p>
<p data-pid="p019">Riz, who had been quiet at his corner of the table, piling leaflets into envelopes, looked up with that flat expression he got when he was about to say something we would not enjoy.</p>
<p data-pid="p020">‘So that is the play now, is it?’ he said. ‘Nice dinners with Tory daddies. Networking.’</p>
<p data-pid="p021">‘It is intelligence gathering,’ Shell said carefully. ‘Know your enemy.’</p>
<p data-pid="p022">‘Know your enemy.’ Riz put his stack down. ‘That is what we said about the benefit circuit. 'Let the posh kids come to us, they will learn something.' Now we are going to them. In their country houses. With our best shoes on.’</p>
<p data-pid="p023">‘It is one dinner,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p024">‘It is never one dinner.’ He stood, stretching. His back probably hurt; he had been hunched over that table for hours. ‘First it is dinner. Then it is a favour. Then you owe them something and call it strategy.’</p>
<p data-pid="p025">‘Charlotte is not asking for favours,’ Shell said. ‘She is giving us access.’</p>
<p data-pid="p026">‘Charlotte is all right,’ Riz said – and it sounded like a concession dragged out of him. ‘But her old man is a Tory MP. He voted for everything. The strike. The closures. And he will vote for CLAUSE 28. And you are going to sit in his dining room and let him feel good about himself for listening to your little record?’</p>
<p data-pid="p027">On the telly behind him, Reagan and Gorbachev were still shaking hands, the same loop over and over.</p>
<p data-pid="p028">‘I am going to find out what scares him,’ I said quietly. ‘And then I am going to use it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p029">Riz looked at me for a long moment.</p>
<p data-pid="p030">‘That is what they say too,’ he said. ‘Right before they turn into them.’</p>
<p data-pid="p031">He grabbed his jacket from the back of a chair.</p>
<p data-pid="p032">‘I will be on the radio if anyone needs me,’ he said. ‘Talking to people who do not need a train ticket to hear us.’</p>
<p data-pid="p033">The door swung shut behind him.</p>
<p data-pid="p034">‘He is not wrong,’ Shell said at last. ‘Not entirely.’</p>
<p data-pid="p035">‘I know,’ I said. ‘But he is not right either. We cannot keep shouting at each other and call it a movement. Sooner or later we have to get inside the rooms where decisions happen.’</p>
<p data-pid="p036">‘And if you get comfortable there?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p037">‘Then you tell me,’ I said. ‘That is your job.’</p>
<p data-pid="p038">She picked up the envelope, turned it over.</p>
<p data-pid="p039">‘Fine,’ she said. ‘But if I have to curtsey, I am blaming you for the rest of my life.’</p>
<p data-pid="p040">*</p>
<p data-pid="p041">We met Charlotte at Paddington under the big destination board, the letters flipping over with that mechanical rattle that sounded like a hundred small decisions. People in Christmas coats hurried past with department store bags. A busker in fingerless gloves played <em>Fairytale of New York</em> on a battered guitar, the words swallowed by the echo.</p>
<p data-pid="p042">Charlotte was wrapped in a dark wool coat that managed to look expensive without bragging. Camera bag across her body, hair twisted under a beret with a small rip at the side.</p>
<p data-pid="p043">‘You came,’ she said, shoulders loosening for a second. ‘I was not sure.’</p>
<p data-pid="p044">‘We flipped a coin,’ Shell said. ‘It landed on 'tell Thatcher to get stuffed', which was both options, so here we are.’</p>
<p data-pid="p045">Charlotte smiled, but her eyes kept sliding up to the board and back, measuring how long it would be before there was no turning back.</p>
<p data-pid="p046">‘I should warn you,’ she said. ‘Dad is… interested. That is the word he used. Which is worse than hostile. Hostile means he has decided. Interested means he is working out where to put you on his map.’</p>
<p data-pid="p047">‘And your mum?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p048">‘My mother will treat you like an avant-garde charity project,’ Charlotte said. ‘Kindly. She is very kind when she is patronising.’</p>
<p data-pid="p049">On the train we found backwards-facing seats at a table. Shell claimed the window, pressing her forehead to the cold glass as the suburbs slid by – terraced houses with tangled Christmas lights, back gardens separated by fences too flimsy to keep anything real out.</p>
<p data-pid="p050">‘What is the plan?’ she said once the ticket inspector had gone.</p>
<p data-pid="p051">‘Plan?’ I said, fiddling with the corner of the EP sleeve sticking out of my rucksack. We had brought the record and a cassette, in case the Haversham sound system was not built for us. I imagined their hi-fi being able to play formats that did not exist yet.</p>
<p data-pid="p052">‘You do have one,’ Shell said. ‘Do not you? You have been banging on about posh leverage for months. 'We cannot just shout at people who already agree, Shell,'’ she mimicked, cruelly accurate.</p>
<p data-pid="p053">‘I thought I would listen,’ I said. ‘See what makes him uncomfortable. What makes him change the subject.’</p>
<p data-pid="p054">Charlotte turned her tea cup between her hands, plastic flexing.</p>
<p data-pid="p055">‘He will test you,’ she said. ‘He will want to know what you have read, not just what you have felt. He will quote Burke and toss in a bit of Disraeli for flavour. You do not need to spar with that. Just be honest. He cannot stand bullshit. He is blind to his own.’</p>
<p data-pid="p056">‘Helpful,’ Shell said. ‘So: do not fake Eton, do not forget which side you are on, do not drink so much wine you tell him the strategy.’</p>
<p data-pid="p057">‘I am not going to tell him our strategy,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p058">‘You will tell him more than you mean to,’ Charlotte said quietly. ‘He is very good at making people talk. I wanted you to know that before we go through the gates.’</p>
<p data-pid="p059">It was the first time she had sounded like a daughter, not a photographer or comrade.</p>
<p data-pid="p060">‘What about you?’ I asked. ‘What is your plan?’</p>
<p data-pid="p061">‘Try very hard not to regress to twelve,’ she said. ‘Fail. You can watch.’</p>
<p data-pid="p062">*</p>
<p data-pid="p063">Deerbrook Hall appeared at the end of a long, curving drive designed purely to make visitors feel small before they even got out of the car. Gravel whispered under the tyres. The house was red brick with stone dressings, big bay windows, a central doorway with columns and a fanlight. If you asked a child to draw “rich people's house”, this was what they would sketch.</p>
<p data-pid="p064">‘It is like a National Trust place,’ Shell muttered as we climbed out. ‘Do we get an audio guide?’</p>
<p data-pid="p065">A man in a dark overcoat came down the steps. Not a butler – younger than that, with a haircut that suggested army or strict school. He took our bags like they weighed nothing.</p>
<p data-pid="p066">‘Miss Haversham,’ he said. ‘Good to have you home. Mr Haversham is in the drawing room. Mrs Haversham is with the caterers.’</p>
<p data-pid="p067">‘Of course she is,’ Charlotte said. ‘Thank you, Tom.’</p>
<p data-pid="p068">Inside, the hall was tiled in black and white squares. Hunting prints climbed the staircase – men in red jackets on horses, hounds coiled at their feet. Between them, portraits watched us: stern men in high collars, women with pearls and impossible waists. The air smelled of beeswax and something richer from the kitchen – meat, herbs, wine.</p>
<p data-pid="p069">‘Coats, please, miss,’ said a woman in a crisp apron, appearing from a side door. She was about my mam's age, hair pinned back, eyes sharp. When my scarf tangled she reached up and helped, hands quick.</p>
<p data-pid="p070">‘You are with Miss Charlotte?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p071">‘That obvious?’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p072">‘Do not worry,’ she replied. ‘We have all been there.’ Then, lower, with a hint of a smile: ‘Kitchens through there, if it gets too much. The kettle belongs to us.’</p>
<p data-pid="p073">Shell's grin flashed. She had found a back entrance.</p>
<p data-pid="p074">We were shown into the drawing room, where Charlotte's father stood with his back to the fireplace as if he had been designed for it. Rupert Haversham was taller than I had imagined, grey hair neatly parted, the sort of face that probably looked the same on a ballot paper as it did in person – steady, reassuring if you did not look at the details.</p>
<p data-pid="p075">He came forward with both hands extended, one for me, one for Shell.</p>
<p data-pid="p076">‘Daniel,’ he said. ‘And Michelle, is it? Charlotte has spoken of you both.’ His grip was firm, the handshake of a man used to agreements in rooms like this.</p>
<p data-pid="p077">‘Shell,’ she said. ‘Only my mam calls me Michelle. When she is angry.’</p>
<p data-pid="p078">‘Shell,’ he repeated, as if filing it. ‘You are very welcome. You find us on a hopeful day.’</p>
<p data-pid="p079">He nodded at the television in the corner, sound off, treaty still looping.</p>
<p data-pid="p080">‘Historic,’ he said. ‘We must give credit where it is due. Not everyone on my benches agrees.’</p>
<p data-pid="p081">‘Your benches?’ I said, before I could stop myself.</p>
<p data-pid="p082">‘Rupert is an MP, Danny,’ Charlotte said, in that tone she used when she was pretending to be casual on my behalf.</p>
<p data-pid="p083">‘One-nation Conservative,’ he added. ‘The old-fashioned kind, before the branding people got involved. We try to make sure the country does not eat itself. We do not always succeed.’</p>
<p data-pid="p084">On the low table at the centre of the room lay our EP, next to a decanter – the white sleeve with Shell's lino-cut of a pithead tower cracking like glass. Someone had been careful not to spill on it.</p>
<p data-pid="p085">‘I have been listening,’ Rupert said. ‘Charlotte has been very insistent. I thought we might give it a spin on something better than a car cassette.’</p>
<p data-pid="p086">‘You have a car cassette?’ Shell said. ‘I thought you would have a man who sings Latin summaries at you.’</p>
<p data-pid="p087">Rupert laughed, unexpectedly genuine.</p>
<p data-pid="p088">‘Oh, I like you,’ he said. ‘Miss… Shell. I hope you are hungry. Cook has outdone herself. We could feed the Soviet delegation twice.’</p>
<p data-pid="p089">*</p>
<p data-pid="p090">Dinner was in a room long enough for your footsteps to echo back. A table ran almost the full length, polished wood buried under a white cloth and more cutlery than I had seen outside a shop. Candles burned in silver sticks. A painting of a stag being brought down by hounds loomed over one end, as if to remind us what happened to anything that strayed.</p>
<p data-pid="p091">‘Start at the outside and work your way in,’ Shell whispered. ‘If you do not know what something is, do not ask. Eat it and hope.’</p>
<p data-pid="p092">Mrs Haversham was all soft edges and pearls, hair set just so, voice as smooth as the soup they put in front of us. She asked polite questions about the band – where we rehearsed, whether our parents worried. When I said my dad was on the sick and my mam did shifts at the supermarket, she nodded sympathetically, then launched into a story about how terribly hard it had been when Rupert was away on parliamentary business when the children were small.</p>
<p data-pid="p093">‘You must have the most extraordinary material for your songs,’ she said. ‘Charlotte says you write about… what was it, dear? The miners?’</p>
<p data-pid="p094">‘The miners' strike, yes,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p095">‘Such an unfortunate business,’ she replied. ‘All that trouble. Still, one cannot hold back progress.’</p>
<p data-pid="p096">Rupert cleared his throat, in that way that meant he thought his wife was about to say something he would have to tidy later.</p>
<p data-pid="p097">‘It was an industrial dispute, Margaret,’ he said. ‘Not trouble. Words matter.’</p>
<p data-pid="p098">‘Oh, they always do for you, dearest,’ she said, patting his hand. ‘That is what we adore about you.’</p>
<p data-pid="p099">I concentrated on not spilling soup down my shirt. The spoon felt wrong in my hand, heavy and alien. Shell saw and casually mirrored how I held mine, giving me something to copy without making a show of it.</p>
<p data-pid="p100">Between courses, footmen – actual footmen, though I was fairly sure they hated the title – topped up glasses. The red wine was smoother than anything we drank at The Furnace. It went to my head differently – not the loose-limbed warmth of cheap plonk, but a creeping fuzziness that made my tongue feel thick and my thoughts half a beat behind.</p>
<p data-pid="p101">‘So,’ Rupert said, once plates had been cleared and lamb arrived with rosemary and potatoes that would have made Mam cry with envy. ‘Tell me about Glass Saints. Why not keep Coalface? A perfectly good, honest word.’</p>
<p data-pid="p102">‘Coalface was the band that shouted,’ I said, surprised at how clear my voice sounded over the clink of cutlery. ‘Glass Saints tries to say something useful after the shouting is done.’</p>
<p data-pid="p103">He tilted his head.</p>
<p data-pid="p104">‘Useful how?’ he said. ‘Useful to whom?’</p>
<p data-pid="p105">‘To people who listened back then and went home and nothing changed,’ I said. ‘We realised we were making them feel less alone, which matters, but we were not giving them anything to do. Now we try to. Directions. Names. Places to turn up.’</p>
<p data-pid="p106">‘And do they?’ he asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p107">‘Some,’ I said. ‘More than before. We have got a warehouse that fills on Thursdays because Shell here knows how to get people in and out without anyone dying.’</p>
<p data-pid="p108">‘High praise indeed,’ Shell said, stabbing a potato.</p>
<p data-pid="p109">‘And these directions,’ he went on, ‘do they include breaking the law? Or merely standing in the street and shouting at me?’</p>
<p data-pid="p110">‘Depends which law,’ I said. ‘And which you.’</p>
<p data-pid="p111">Mrs Haversham made a little sound, somewhere between a laugh and a warning. Charlotte's foot brushed mine under the table – not to stop me, but to anchor me.</p>
<p data-pid="p112">‘We tell them where to send letters, for a start,’ Shell said lightly. ‘Keeps your postbag interesting.’</p>
<p data-pid="p113">‘Ah yes,’ he said. ‘The letters. I do read them, you know. Contrary to popular belief, we do not burn missives from the provinces for warmth.’</p>
<p data-pid="p114">He turned back to me.</p>
<p data-pid="p115">‘Daniel, forgive a blunt question,’ he said. ‘What is it you actually want? Not in a slogan. In a sentence you would defend in a room full of people who disagree.’</p>
<p data-pid="p116">I felt the weight of eyes. Mrs Haversham paused with her fork halfway to her mouth. Charlotte watched me with a look that said: you do not owe him anything, but if you speak, make it count.</p>
<p data-pid="p117">‘I do not want anyone choosing between heat and food,’ I said slowly. ‘I do not want a kid coming home to bailiffs and an empty space where the sofa was. I do not want anyone dying at work because someone decided profit mattered more than a safety rail. I want those decisions made by people who have lived it, not just read it in briefing notes.’</p>
<p data-pid="p118">Rupert chewed, swallowed, dabbed his lips.</p>
<p data-pid="p119">‘And you think that is not the current state of affairs?’ he said. ‘You think your country is run entirely by ghouls who have never set foot in a pit or a council flat?’</p>
<p data-pid="p120">‘I think when you sleep in places like this most nights,’ I said, ‘it is easy to forget what mould smells like.’</p>
<p data-pid="p121">Shell's hand tightened round her napkin. Under the table, Charlotte's foot pressed harder on mine, not to silence me but to keep me steady.</p>
<p data-pid="p122">Rupert's eyes sharpened for a second. Then he smiled – a politician's smile that never quite reached his pupils.</p>
<p data-pid="p123">‘Point taken,’ he said. ‘I grew up in a semi in Romford, for what it is worth. Father was a clerk in the Post Office. We did not have stags on the walls.’</p>
<p data-pid="p124">‘Now you have three,’ Shell said, nodding at the paintings. ‘Looks like you have caught up.’</p>
<p data-pid="p125">He laughed again, but it was clipped.</p>
<p data-pid="p126">‘We saved,’ he said. ‘We worked. We made choices. That is all. And we have a duty to ensure others have the chance to do the same, not to promise them the earth and deliver bankruptcy. That is what I mean by one-nation Conservatism. Not pity. Responsibility.’</p>
<p data-pid="p127">He raised his glass.</p>
<p data-pid="p128">‘To responsibility,’ he said.</p>
<p data-pid="p129">Mrs Haversham dutifully echoed. Charlotte touched her glass to mine but did not drink.</p>
<p data-pid="p130">*</p>
<p data-pid="p131">After dinner there was coffee and something sweet in the drawing room, a change of pace that felt rehearsed long before we were invited. Someone had put our EP on the turntable, wired into speakers big enough to shift the foundations if they felt like it.</p>
<p data-pid="p132">‘Side A,’ Rupert said. ‘Let us hear your… what is it called? <em>Cracks in Glass Houses</em>?’</p>
<p data-pid="p133">‘<em>Cracks in Glass Houses</em>,’ I corrected automatically.</p>
<p data-pid="p134">The needle dropped with a faint scratch. The first riff crept in – Alex's guitar, clean and tense, then Pete's bass putting a low line under it, the drums giving a heartbeat. My own voice followed, younger than I felt sat here in borrowed blazer, singing about windows and watchers and men who talked about “stability” while rattling locks on other people's doors.</p>
<p data-pid="p135">I watched faces instead of listening to lyrics. Mrs Haversham looked politely interested, head tilting in time, listening to rhythm more than words. Rupert's jaw flickered once as I sang about cameras in stairwells and letters that went unanswered.</p>
<p data-pid="p136">‘Good diction,’ he said when it ended. ‘You can hear the words. Not that dreadful shredded shouting thing.’</p>
<p data-pid="p137">‘Thrash,’ Shell suggested.</p>
<p data-pid="p138">‘Yes. That. I cannot abide it. Colleagues' children inflict it on them. They sit blinking behind their <em>Telegraphs</em> pretending to keep up. This, at least, sounds like music.’</p>
<p data-pid="p139">‘It is music,’ Shell said. ‘That is the point.’</p>
<p data-pid="p140">‘It is also,’ he went on, ‘slightly unfair. But that is music's job. To be unfair in an interesting way.’</p>
<p data-pid="p141">‘Unfair how?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p142">‘All this 'we see you, we know your names',’ he said. ‘You make it sound like a shadowy cabal pulling strings, rather than hundreds of relatively dull men and women trying to keep the lights on without being lynched by whichever faction is howling loudest.’</p>
<p data-pid="p143">‘That is not how it feels on the receiving end,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p144">‘And that disconnect,’ he said, ‘is what keeps people like you in work. I do not begrudge you it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p145">The second track began. I let it run. I was too conscious now of my own recorded voice in this room, caught before this conversation, before this house. It felt like a version of me who had not yet smelt these curtains or seen these shelves of Hansard with Rupert's name on brass plaques.</p>
<p data-pid="p146">Charlotte slipped out at some point, camera in hand. I saw the flash once in the doorway, catching the curve of her mother's hand on her father's sleeve, the way his head tipped towards mine as if we were already debating when we were just listening.</p>
<p data-pid="p147">When the record clicked off, Rupert replaced it carefully in its sleeve, as if it were a document.</p>
<p data-pid="p148">‘Thank you,’ he said. ‘For trusting us with this.’</p>
<p data-pid="p149">That was when I saw how Charlotte would shoot him – light from the lamp on the lines round his eyes, faint sheen on his forehead from wine and central heating and holding his selves in place.</p>
<p data-pid="p150">‘Would you walk with me, Daniel?’ he said, standing. ‘Just for a moment. There is a study where we can talk without upsetting the china.’</p>
<p data-pid="p151">Shell shot me a look that translated as: ten minutes or I break in. I followed.</p>
<p data-pid="p152">*</p>
<p data-pid="p153">The study was smaller than I expected, cluttered rather than grand. Bookshelves ran from floor to ceiling, stuffed not only with Hansard, Burke and biographies of men in the same tie as Rupert, but detective novels, military histories, atlases. On the desk, a green-shaded lamp lit stacks of paper held with elastic bands. Photographs lined one wall – black-and-white shots of Labour leaders and Tory grandees, all shaking hands the same careful way, each framed like a hunting trophy.</p>
<p data-pid="p154">Rupert poured something dark from a decanter into two small glasses.</p>
<p data-pid="p155">‘Port,’ he said. ‘It will either settle your stomach or finish you off. Either way, we will get honesty.’</p>
<p data-pid="p156">I took a sip. It was sweet and heavy, sticking to my teeth.</p>
<p data-pid="p157">‘You intimidate me,’ I said, before I could varnish it. ‘Not in a boo-hiss way. In a you-know-how-these-rooms-work-and-I-do-not way.’</p>
<p data-pid="p158">‘Good,’ he said. ‘Fear is useful. So is admitting it. Most of my colleagues have never done the latter.’</p>
<p data-pid="p159">He perched on the arm of a leather chair, not quite relaxed, not quite on parade.</p>
<p data-pid="p160">‘You are angry,’ he said. ‘I understand why. Your world has been upended by forces outside your control. People have lied to you, or not told you the whole truth. In that respect, we are not so different.’</p>
<p data-pid="p161">‘What is your excuse?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p162">‘In my case,’ he said, ‘the lies come shrink-wrapped as policy papers. We call something a community charge instead of a poll tax and pretend that changes the nature. We talk about incentivising work when we mean removing a safety net.’</p>
<p data-pid="p163">He set his glass down, fingers tapping the stem.</p>
<p data-pid="p164">‘You ask why we vote for things,’ he went on. ‘Because we believe – or choose to believe – that the alternative would be worse. Because the state cannot do everything without collapsing under its own weight. Because I have seen governments promise too much and deliver nothing. Chaos. Inflation. Empty shelves. The sort of thing that makes coups feel attractive.’</p>
<p data-pid="p165">He looked at me.</p>
<p data-pid="p166">‘You think we are afraid of you because you shout and march and throw paint,’ he said. ‘We are not. We have handled that since before you were born. What we fear is unworkability. Systems seizing. Courts that cannot process cases. Councils that cannot collect. The appearance of incompetence. That, more than moral argument, is what brings governments down.’</p>
<p data-pid="p167">I watched him. Certain words soured in his mouth – unworkable, collapse, incompetence.</p>
<p data-pid="p168">‘So if something looks manageable on paper,’ I said, ‘if the books balance, you do not much care who gets hurt at the margins.’</p>
<p data-pid="p169">‘I would not put it that crudely,’ he said. ‘But yes, the numbers must add up. The centre must hold. My constituents – small business owners, pensioners, the mythical man in the middle – fear chaos more than they fear a little unfairness. They accept a degree of pain if they think it ends in stability.’</p>
<p data-pid="p170">‘And if they stop accepting it?’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p171">He smiled, thinly.</p>
<p data-pid="p172">‘Then we have a problem,’ he said. ‘Not when you riot. That is containable. Messy for a weekend, then we sweep the glass and the tabloids have their pictures. The real problem is when decent, quiet people – the ones who pay their bills and tut at the news and vote out of habit – decide something is intolerable. When Mrs Jenkins on the corner, who has voted Conservative since Churchill, refuses to pay her charge. When the local vicar preaches about injustice instead of charity. When the queue outside the magistrates' court is full of people who look like my brother, not caricatures from a cartoon.’</p>
<p data-pid="p173">He stared into his glass.</p>
<p data-pid="p174">‘You show me that,’ he said softly, ‘and I will show you a policy wobbling on the edge.’</p>
<p data-pid="p175">I did not write any of this down at the time, but I never forgot it. Years later, when Charlotte and I stood on a street in Finchley with a camera and a clipboard, I thought about unworkability and quiet respectables. Access and movement, married together: ordinary folk refusing to stay in their lanes, the gears seizing because the parts would not fit where they were supposed to.</p>
<p data-pid="p176">‘You realise that sounds like instructions,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p177">‘Call it civic education,’ he replied. ‘If you did not work it out on your own, you are not as clever as Charlotte claims.’</p>
<p data-pid="p178">There it was, tucked in the compliment – a small jab, a reminder that his daughter's belief in me was another column in his ledger.</p>
<p data-pid="p179">‘Do you worry,’ I said, ‘that she will end up on the other side of one of your votes?’</p>
<p data-pid="p180">‘She already is,’ he said. ‘Have you met her friends?’ There was fondness in it, and exasperation. ‘I tell myself it is healthy. A family should be a small version of the country. If you cannot argue at the dinner table, there is no hope for Parliament.’</p>
<p data-pid="p181">‘And when she photographs someone whose life has been wrecked by your decisions?’ I asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p182">‘Then I hope she shows me the prints,’ he said. ‘And I hope I have the decency to feel uncomfortable. But I also hope she understands that governing is not the same as protesting. Sometimes you choose the least bad option and spend the rest of your career defending it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p183">‘Do you ever admit you got it wrong?’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p184">He looked as if I had asked whether he flew to work.</p>
<p data-pid="p185">‘Not in public,’ he said. ‘That is suicide. In private? More than you would think. We keep lists in our heads of votes we regret. We just do not write them down.’</p>
<p data-pid="p186">‘Maybe someone should,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p187">He studied me, then nodded once.</p>
<p data-pid="p188">‘Perhaps,’ he said. ‘Now. I have spoken more frankly than is wise. You may tell your comrades the enemy is human. They can pin my face up and throw darts with a clear conscience.’</p>
<p data-pid="p189">‘The enemy,’ I said slowly, ‘is not exactly you.’</p>
<p data-pid="p190">‘Flattering,’ he said. ‘And inaccurate. I am part of a system you despise. Own it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p191">‘The enemy,’ I said, feeling the words arrange themselves, ‘is the story you tell yourselves that lets you sleep. The one where the people who suffer are either faceless or guilty. If we can break that story, maybe the rest moves.’</p>
<p data-pid="p192">He lifted his glass in a small salute, as if I had passed a test.</p>
<p data-pid="p193">‘Then that is your job, Mr Ashcroft,’ he said. ‘Mine is to keep enough of the system running that we still have something to argue about.’</p>
<p data-pid="p194">*</p>
<p data-pid="p195">On my way back I ducked into the kitchen.</p>
<p data-pid="p196">The air was warm, steamed windows, radio low with yet another bulletin about treaties. The cook – broad-shouldered woman in an apron – spooned gravy into a jug, movements practised. The housekeeper who had taken our coats dried glasses.</p>
<p data-pid="p197">‘There you are,’ Shell said, perched on a stool by the back door, cigarette between her fingers, one leg tucked under. ‘I was about to organise a search party with napkins for flags.’</p>
<p data-pid="p198">‘Got cornered,’ I said. ‘In an oak-panel confession box.’</p>
<p data-pid="p199">‘How was His Lordship?’ she asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p200">‘Human,’ I said. ‘Which is irritating.’</p>
<p data-pid="p201">The cook snorted.</p>
<p data-pid="p202">‘They usually are,’ she said. ‘Makes it harder to hate them while they are being a pain.’</p>
<p data-pid="p203">‘Do you live in?’ I asked her. It felt wrong to pretend the food had appeared by magic.</p>
<p data-pid="p204">‘God, no,’ she said. ‘Flat in the village. Kids at the comp. This is just where I perform miracles for the honourable gentleman and his lady wife. You lot are a nice change. How is the lamb?’</p>
<p data-pid="p205">‘Perfect,’ I said. ‘My mam would want the recipe.’</p>
<p data-pid="p206">‘Tell her it is butter and lies,’ she said. ‘That is what holds this place together.’</p>
<p data-pid="p207">Mrs Dean – the housekeeper – passed me a slice of something from a tray.</p>
<p data-pid="p208">‘You look like your blood sugar is falling,’ she said. ‘Eat before you keel over and we have to explain why there is a punk in the pantry.’</p>
<p data-pid="p209">Shell devoured her slice in two bites.</p>
<p data-pid="p210">‘You lot always watch,’ she said, licking crumbs from her thumb. ‘Every little drama.’</p>
<p data-pid="p211">‘That is our job,’ Mrs Dean said. ‘We are the witnesses. We know whose shoes get left in the hall and who cries in the cloakroom. We know when there are cameras coming and when the good china comes out. We see the ladies practising their concerned faces in the mirror.’</p>
<p data-pid="p212">‘You ever tempted to swap the wine for vinegar?’ Shell asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p213">‘Only on Budget Day,’ the cook said.</p>
<p data-pid="p214">We all laughed. For a moment it was just people in a warm room sharing a joke, not two sides of a class line borrowing each other's air.</p>
<p data-pid="p215">‘I grew up on a council estate,’ Mrs Dean said suddenly. ‘Dad was a postman. Mum did nights at the old folks' home. We watched Parliament on the telly and shouted. Now I iron the shirts that go on the blokes in the pictures. Funny old world, is it not?’</p>
<p data-pid="p216">‘It is,’ I said. ‘Do you think they listen? When people shout?’</p>
<p data-pid="p217">She shrugged.</p>
<p data-pid="p218">‘Sometimes,’ she said. ‘If the right people are doing the shouting. That is the trick, love. Never mind the volume. It is who they recognise in the crowd that scares them.’</p>
<p data-pid="p219">Something clicked into place at that. It was what Rupert had been saying, in more expensive words.</p>
<p data-pid="p220">‘Thanks,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p221">‘For the cake?’ she asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p222">‘For the translation,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p223">Shell slid off the stool and stubbed her cigarette in a saucer.</p>
<p data-pid="p224">‘Come on,’ she said. ‘Before Charlotte's mum decides we have ruined the silver by looking at it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p225">*</p>
<p data-pid="p226">On the train back to London the carriage was quieter. People dozed under coats or read paperbacks. The man opposite had <em>The Times</em> folded open on his lap, front page showing Reagan and Gorbachev again, headline using words like peace and era.</p>
<p data-pid="p227">Charlotte leaned her head on the window, watching our reflections flicker over the black smear of countryside.</p>
<p data-pid="p228">‘I hate that house,’ she said quietly. ‘I love it too. Which is worse.’</p>
<p data-pid="p229">‘Your dad is not a monster,’ Shell said. ‘He is… I do not know. A very clever brick in a wall.’</p>
<p data-pid="p230">‘He is brilliant,’ Charlotte said. ‘And stubborn. He taught me to argue. He just did not expect me to use it on him.’</p>
<p data-pid="p231">‘He said something useful,’ I said. ‘By accident.’</p>
<p data-pid="p232">‘I doubt it was an accident,’ she replied. ‘He knows exactly what he is doing when he opens his mouth.’</p>
<p data-pid="p233">I told them about the study, the way he had framed it. Not right and wrong, not rich and poor. Unworkable. Chaos. The quiet people at the magistrates' court in good shoes and Sunday coats, saying no. Mrs Jenkins burning her poll tax bill for the local paper.</p>
<p data-pid="p234">‘He does not care about right or wrong,’ I said. ‘He cares about what looks unworkable. What frightens his own lot. So we show him that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p235">Charlotte turned from the glass, eyes catching mine.</p>
<p data-pid="p236">‘Finchley,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p237">‘What?’ Shell asked.</p>
<p data-pid="p238">‘Not his constituency,’ Charlotte said. ‘Hendon is Rupert’s. Finchley is <em>hers</em> – Thatcher’s. That is where her “own lot” live. All those Mrs Jenkinses who have always voted for her because she fixed the village hall roof and sent a wreath when their husbands died.’</p>
<p data-pid="p239">‘And if suddenly they are the ones at the front of the picture, not us,’ I said, ‘what then?’</p>
<p data-pid="p240">‘Then he has to choose,’ she said. ‘Between his story about responsibility and the faces he cannot file under troublemakers any more.’</p>
<p data-pid="p241">Shell frowned.</p>
<p data-pid="p242">‘You are talking about using people,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p243">‘We are talking about listening to them,’ I said. ‘Taking their stories where they do the most damage. Like we do with miners and nurses and queers, except this time it is people Tory papers think look respectable. We do not write their lines. We give them a stage.’</p>
<p data-pid="p244">‘And if they do not want it?’ Shell said. ‘If they are happy to pay and tut at us from armchairs?’</p>
<p data-pid="p245">‘Then we keep doing what we are doing,’ I said. ‘But after tonight, I do not think they all are. We just have not met them yet.’</p>
<p data-pid="p246">Charlotte pulled her knees up on the seat.</p>
<p data-pid="p247">‘I can get commissions in Finchley,’ she said slowly. ‘Local colour pieces. 'How ordinary voters feel about the new charge.' Editors love that. They think it is safe. They do not realise what they put in my hands when they send me there.’</p>
<p data-pid="p248">‘And the posh kids at the gigs,’ I added. ‘The ones in your world and ours. They have parents, uncles, godparents who are councillors, magistrates, association chairs. We get them listening in the right direction.’</p>
<p data-pid="p249">Shell sighed.</p>
<p data-pid="p250">‘I wanted December for teaching kids to write angry carols,’ she said. ‘Instead I am going to end up running some cross-class intelligence operation, am I not?’</p>
<p data-pid="p251">‘You are very good at lists,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p252">‘Do not compliment me into a breakdown,’ she replied, but there was a small smile.</p>
<p data-pid="p253">Outside, the lights of the city started to string themselves along the horizon. In a few minutes we would pull into Paddington and be back in our world of cold flats, shared chips and late meetings under strip lights. The treaty would be on front pages tomorrow, telling everyone the big dangers were under control.</p>
<p data-pid="p254">We knew better, even if we could not yet put it neatly. The danger was not just in the missiles being dismantled in some distant silo. It was in the calculations in rooms like Rupert's study. In the way fear of chaos could be turned into obedience. Into a quiet shrug when a neighbour went under.</p>
<p data-pid="p255">Later, when people said no one could have foreseen the scale of the Poll Tax revolt, I thought of that evening – of port in cut glass, of a man in a tailored suit calmly admitting the shape of the thing that scared him.</p>
<p data-pid="p256">We had time to build towards it. A few years, if we were lucky. Long enough to find the faces we needed in places like Finchley. Long enough to take the tales from kitchens and back doors and magistrates' waiting rooms and lay them out in photographs and songs.</p>
<p data-pid="p257">Long enough, just, to make the story unworkable.</p>
