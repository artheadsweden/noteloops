<p data-pid="p001">The cardboard box gave up halfway between the bedroom and the living room. The side split with a tired sigh and everything tumbled out across the rug: tapes, photographs, folded leaflets, envelopes with the glue long since dead.</p>
<p data-pid="p002">I sat down on the floor before my back could complain about it and let the mess settle around me. C90s and C60s skidded to a halt against the coffee table, some in their cracked plastic cases, some bare with only the handwriting on the inlays to tell them apart. COALFACE – DEMO, one said in my early block capitals. ORGREAVE – SHELL/NUM WOMEN, another. POLL TAX DEF PACK – DRAFT. The ink on some had faded to the colour of an old bruise, but the grooves were still there if you knew how to read them.</p>
<p data-pid="p003">Underneath the tapes were photographs, curled at the corners where damp had got in. One of Shell in The Furnace office with a biro behind her ear and three phones wedged into whatever bit of shoulder and cheek she could spare. One of my dad, Bill, outside Grimethorpe Colliery in his donkey jacket, hand up to his brow against a winter sun, the slag heap rising grey behind him. One of a packed hall, fists in the air, a banner half-visible along the top edge of the frame. NO POLL TAX. I remembered the heat of that night like it was something I could still step into if I closed my eyes and leaned the right way.</p>
<p data-pid="p004">None of it was an accident. That was the part people never believed.</p>
<p data-pid="p005">‘You all right down there?’</p>
<p data-pid="p006">The voice came from the doorway. I looked up. Keira was leaning on the frame, one hand hooked into the strap of her rucksack, the other cupping a cardboard coffee from the place on the corner. She was twenty-two, or twenty-three, somewhere in that age where the years don’t stick yet. Journalism student, neighbour in the flat upstairs, occasional cat-feeder when I went north. She was finishing a dissertation on something to do with ‘counter-narratives in British protest movements’ – I had read the title once on a printout she left in the hallway and understood about half of it.</p>
<p data-pid="p007">She had her own battles, too. I had seen her come back from gig shifts with that particular kind of exhaustion that reminded me of my mam after a late at the supermarket. Different uniform, same empty eyes. She had helped organise a rent strike in our block last year, spreadsheets and WhatsApp groups instead of phone trees and photocopied leaflets, but the principle was familiar enough.</p>
<p data-pid="p008">‘Fine,’ I said. ‘Box surrendered. I won the war.’</p>
<p data-pid="p009">She stepped over a small drift of cassette inlays and perched on the arm of the sofa, peering down.</p>
<p data-pid="p010">‘Wow,’ she said. ‘Ancient artefacts.’</p>
<p data-pid="p011">On the television, the sound was turned low but the captions marched along faithfully. THIRTY-FIVE YEARS SINCE FALL OF THATCHER, the headline said. Grainy footage of a younger Margaret in a blue suit flashed on screen, then a cut to some professor with tidy hair in front of a bookcase. That was what had set me off this morning – seeing the date on the news, remembering I had a box somewhere with her name on it.</p>
<p data-pid="p012">‘Careful,’ I said, nodding at the tapes. ‘Those ancient artefacts were built as weapons.’</p>
<p data-pid="p013">‘What, mysterious brown plastic rectangles?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p014">‘Among other things,’ I said. ‘They kept some people awake at night, put it that way.’</p>
<p data-pid="p015">I picked one tape out of the pile and held it up to the light. The plastic was cloudy, the screw heads inside dull. In my handwriting across the inlay: COALFACE – LIVE AT 100 CLUB.</p>
<p data-pid="p016">‘They’re saying it was inevitable,’ I said. ‘Demographic shifts. Europe. Cabinet fatigue. All that. He just said “the street protest element was significant but not decisive”.’</p>
<p data-pid="p017">‘That’s what they always say,’ Keira said. ‘If it doesn’t happen in a committee room, it doesn’t count.’ She paused. ‘It is the same with the rent stuff. We got the council to back down on evictions, but the papers made it sound like a policy review. Nothing about the sixty families who refused to leave.’</p>
<p data-pid="p018">She slid off the arm and crouched properly, picking up one of the photographs. It was the one of The Furnace from the back of the main hall: lights, bodies, the band a small blur of movement at the far end. You could not see my face, just a silhouette with a guitar and a microphone stand.</p>
<p data-pid="p019">‘This was here?’ she asked. ‘In this bit of London?’</p>
<p data-pid="p020">‘Round the corner from my place in Dalston, East London,’ I said. ‘Building’s a yoga studio now. You can still see where we painted the sign if the sun hits it right, under the new logo. THE FURNACE. We did not think it would last a year. It nearly lasted ten.’</p>
<p data-pid="p021">‘And this is you shouting at people?’ She tilted the photo.</p>
<p data-pid="p022">‘That’s me shouting at people,’ I agreed. ‘We were very good at that. The shouting, I mean.’</p>
<p data-pid="p023">She sat back on her heels and looked about the room. It was nothing special: two-seater sofa that had seen better days, cheap bookcases holding the things I had not quite got round to throwing away, a small stereo with speakers that were older than she was, a portable record deck I’d bought in a fit of nostalgia a few years back. The kitchen was separated by a half-wall, a pair of mugs in the sink, a loaf of bread in a paper bag, a jar of marmalade with the lid not quite on.</p>
<p data-pid="p024">Only the walls gave anything away. Band posters, most of them ours or someone’s we’d played with. A black-and-white photograph of a march, people pouring over a bridge like a human river.</p>
<p data-pid="p025">On the floor by the sofa, another box. This one held videotapes, labelled in Shell’s neat hand. POLL TAX – COACH GRID MEETING, read one. STEWARD TRAINING. COURT DAY. FINCHLEY FACES – MASTER.</p>
<p data-pid="p026">Keira nudged it with her foot. ‘How many of these have you got?’</p>
<p data-pid="p027">‘Of the VHS?’ I said. ‘Dozens. Somewhere in the boxes in the bedroom. Charlotte kept the negatives of the stills. I suppose the university or someone has them now. Or a skip. Hard to tell with universities.’</p>
<p data-pid="p028">There was a brief silence. On the television the professor was replaced by a clip of Trafalgar Square in chaos: smoke, police lines, young faces twisted in anger or fear. I could not hear the commentary, but I did not need it. I had heard every version they’d ever written.</p>
<p data-pid="p029">‘You know,’ Keira said, ‘we’re doing a thing on this for the student station. Thatcher. The miners’ strike. Poll Tax. All that. “Lives behind the headlines”, they’re calling it. Very BBC.’</p>
<p data-pid="p030">‘Catchy,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p031">‘We’ve got politicians and academics and a former chief constable. Couple of talking heads from think tanks. My tutor keeps going on about “structural factors”.’ She picked up another tape, turned it over. ‘I said we should get someone who was actually there.’</p>
<p data-pid="p032">‘Plenty of us were there,’ I said.</p>
<p data-pid="p033">‘Yeah, but you live downstairs,’ she said. ‘And you have…’ She gestured to the sprawl of cardboard and plastic. ‘Evidence. Everyone else just has opinions.’</p>
<p data-pid="p034">‘Evidence,’ I repeated. The word sat heavy on my tongue. We had not called it that when we were stuffing it into boxes, back when the ink was still wet. Proof, maybe. Back-up. Insurance for the day they lied.</p>
<p data-pid="p035">I pushed a pile of photographs aside to clear space on the carpet and sat back, legs stretched out. My knees complained in a way that would have made my twenty-year-old self laugh.</p>
<p data-pid="p036">‘You don’t keep forty years of this lot by accident,’ I said. ‘We did not just forget to throw it out. Every tape, every leaflet, every summons – someone made a choice to keep it. We thought: one day they’ll say we imagined it, so we’d better make it hard for them.’</p>
<p data-pid="p037">She finished her coffee and put the empty cup on the table. For a moment she watched the television. The footage had moved on to a shot of Thatcher leaving Number Ten for the last time, cheeks wet but spine rigid, Denis’s hand at her elbow.</p>
<p data-pid="p038">‘Do you think you brought her down?’ Keira asked, as if she were asking whether I wanted sugar in my tea. ‘You lot. The “enemy within” and all that.’</p>
<p data-pid="p039">I had mentioned the phrase to her once before, weeks back, when she had asked why I kept a box labelled ENEMY WITHIN under my bed. She had laughed at the time, thought I was joking. Now she was not laughing.</p>
<p data-pid="p040">The phrase hung in the room like smoke.</p>
<p data-pid="p041">In my head, I could hear other phrases layered underneath: riot. Thugs. Scum. Responsible citizens. We had been all of those, depending on who you asked and what they wanted to prove.</p>
<p data-pid="p042">I leaned over and turned the television off. The room lost its flicker and went oddly lopsided without it. Outside, a bus pulled away from the stop with a long exhale, tyres rolling through last night’s rain.</p>
<p data-pid="p043">‘I can’t prove anything,’ I said. ‘That’s the short answer. There is not a graph you can point to with “Danny Ashcroft” on one axis and “Prime Ministerial stability” on the other. No neat line going down.’</p>
<p data-pid="p044">She smiled at that, then sobered. ‘And the long answer?’</p>
<p data-pid="p045">‘The long answer,’ I said, ‘is in those boxes.’</p>
<p data-pid="p046">I put the tape I’d been holding on the coffee table and reached for another, one of Shell’s. POLL TAX DEF PACK – MASTER in her neat capitals. Next to it I set the Finchley tape, and one of the early Coalface demos.</p>
<p data-pid="p047">‘They’ll tell you the big things,’ I said. ‘The letters to Europe. The argument in the back of a car. The day a few very calm men walked down a corridor to tell her she was finished. They like that bit, because it happens indoors, in rooms they’re allowed to film. It looks like control. It looks tidy.’</p>
<p data-pid="p048">I tapped each spine in turn.</p>
<p data-pid="p049">‘They won’t tell you about this,’ I said. ‘They might mention “grass-roots protest”, like it’s a sort of weather system. Background noise. But they won’t sit you down and say: there were five things, five fingerprints, that our lot left on that woman’s downfall. Noise. Base. Movement. Access. Disruption. If you trace them, one after the other, you can feel where the cracks started.’</p>
<p data-pid="p050">Keira shifted on the sofa, shoes off now, feet tucked up under her.</p>
<p data-pid="p051">‘Five fingerprints?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p052">‘We first wrote those five words down at Mam’s kitchen table in ’85,’ I said. ‘Trying to name what we were building. First one was noise – songs on C90s that went further than we ever could. Second was base: a place built out of nothing, where people could meet and plan. Third was movement – coaches, stewarding, all the dull bits that get bodies safely from A to B. Fourth was access – getting inside the worlds that did not want us there. And the fifth was disruption: films and court packs and all the paper and pressure that stopped them rewriting what they did and carried the fight into places they thought were safe.’</p>
<p data-pid="p053">I nudged the Finchley tape towards her.</p>
<p data-pid="p054">‘That one sits mostly in the fourth,’ I said. ‘Influence. Finchley Faces. But they all bleed into each other if you look closely enough.’</p>
<p data-pid="p055">She watched my hands as if the tapes might shift under their own weight.</p>
<p data-pid="p056">‘Do you ever…’ She hesitated. ‘Do you ever worry you’re giving yourself too much credit?’</p>
<p data-pid="p057">‘Every day,’ I said. ‘That’s why it’s taken me this long to open these boxes. You don’t want to be the ageing bore in the corner telling anyone who’ll listen that he, personally, changed history by shouting into a stolen microphone.’</p>
<p data-pid="p058">‘You did shout into microphones, though,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p059">‘Oh, I shouted plenty,’ I said. ‘We all did. But shouting’s just weather. What interested me, later on, was the infrastructure underneath it. The phone trees. The coach grids. The boring bits you never see in the documentaries. That’s where we stopped just being loud and started getting in the way.’</p>
<p data-pid="p060">She picked up the Coal Not Dole poster from where it had slipped down behind the sofa and propped it back on the windowsill.</p>
<p data-pid="p061">‘I can’t prove I helped take a Prime Minister down,’ I said, hearing the words as much as speaking them. ‘But I know where some of the cracks started, because I was there with a chisel. And I can show you the grooves we left if you like. They’re all here.’</p>
<p data-pid="p062">She considered that, then glanced towards the silent television.</p>
<p data-pid="p063">‘My lot will say it’s anecdotal,’ she said. ‘My tutor loves that word.’</p>
<p data-pid="p064">‘Course he does,’ I said. ‘It lets him file people away and get back to his graphs. Thing is, these aren’t just anecdotes. They’re exhibits. We kept them for you. For whoever turned up one day wanting a different version of events.’</p>
<p data-pid="p065">Her head snapped back to me. ‘For me?’</p>
<p data-pid="p066">‘Not you personally,’ I said. ‘We did not know your name. But we knew there’d be some kid, forty years on, trying to write their way through the official story. We talked about it, you know. Back then. After the worst bits. “They’ll say it did not happen like this,” Shell said. “So we best make sure we’ve got proof.”’</p>
<p data-pid="p067">Keira’s fingers tightened on the edge of the coffee table.</p>
<p data-pid="p068">‘You talked about that at the time?’ she asked. ‘Not just afterwards?’</p>
<p data-pid="p069">‘At the time,’ I said. ‘Orgreave. Chernobyl. Hillsborough. Trafalgar. Every time the telly lied about what we’d just watched with our own eyes, somebody in the room said: “Keep the tapes. Keep the summons. One day some poor sod will need them.”’ I shrugged. ‘Looks like that poor sod turned up.’</p>
<p data-pid="p070">She laughed, a quick, startled sound, and pushed her hair back from her face.</p>
<p data-pid="p071">‘All right,’ she said. ‘Say I am that poor sod. What do I do?’</p>
<p data-pid="p072">‘You listen,’ I said. ‘You watch. You write it down in a way they can’t ignore. That’s your end. Mine is to make sure you don’t have to take my word for it.’</p>
<p data-pid="p073">I got to my feet with more care than I once would have needed.</p>
<p data-pid="p074">‘First rule of all this,’ I added. ‘You can’t talk about Thatcher on an empty stomach. That’s one other thing the structural analysts never mention. I’ll make tea. You start a list.’</p>
<p data-pid="p075">‘A list?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p076">‘Tapes we need to get digitised,’ I said, nodding at the sprawl. ‘Photographs that have not seen daylight since nineteen ninety. Names you’ll have to change for legal reasons. If we’re doing this, we’re doing it properly. No one gets to say it all vanished because we could not be bothered to label a box.’</p>
<p data-pid="p077">In the kitchen, I filled the kettle and spooned tea into the pot. Through the half-wall I could see her arranging tapes and photographs on the table in rough chronological piles, lips moving a little as she tried to sound out my old handwriting. She had already drawn two columns on a fresh page: THEN and NOW.</p>
<p data-pid="p078">I poured hot water over the leaves and let the steam curl up into my face.</p>
<p data-pid="p079">Brown plastic, curled photographs, a tally disc, and a kettle that took an age to boil. That was the arsenal.</p>
<p data-pid="p080">‘All right?’ Keira called.</p>
<p data-pid="p081">I picked up the teapot and two mugs and carried them back through, careful not to tread on anything important.</p>
<p data-pid="p082">‘All right,’ I said. ‘You wanted lives behind the headlines. Let’s see if you can keep up.’</p>
<p data-pid="p083">She grinned and uncapped her pen. On the table, she had started a second list under the first. Five numbers, evenly spaced down the page.</p>
<p data-pid="p084">‘Noise, base, movement, access, disruption,’ she read out, brow furrowed. ‘Is that right?’</p>
<p data-pid="p085">‘Close enough,’ I said. ‘We’ll argue about the labels later. For now, they’re just fingerprints. Places where we pressed ourselves into the story so they could not scrape us off without leaving marks.’</p>
<p data-pid="p086">The tape on the table, the one about the Square, caught the light as I sat down, the title flashing up for a second before it dulled again.</p>
<p data-pid="p087">I wrapped my hands round the mug and let the heat sink into stiff fingers.</p>
<p data-pid="p088">‘So,’ I said. ‘There’s this lad. Seventeen. Coal dust under his nails, guitar he bought off his cousin, a dad who thinks music is what you put on in the pub after a shift. One morning – not that morning, but later, after things got worse – he hears a phrase on the radio he’s never forgotten. “The enemy within.”’</p>
<p data-pid="p089">Keira’s pen moved.</p>
<p data-pid="p090">‘I should warn you,’ I added. ‘He grows up painfully slowly. He shouts before he listens. He thinks tapes can topple governments.’</p>
<p data-pid="p091">‘Does he?’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p092">‘He finds out tapes can do something,’ I said. ‘You can decide for yourself how much. That’s your job now. Mine was to make sure you’d have something to measure your theories against.’</p>
<p data-pid="p093">Outside, a siren rose and fell. Somewhere, a bus stop display ticked over to a new number.</p>
<p data-pid="p094">On my table, the boxes waited.</p>
<p data-pid="p095">‘Right,’ I said. ‘Grimethorpe. 1984. Before any of this lot existed. Before we knew how small and how big we were. You ready?’</p>
<p data-pid="p096">‘Always,’ she said.</p>
<p data-pid="p097">So I started.</p></div>
