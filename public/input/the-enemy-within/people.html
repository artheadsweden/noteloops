<h3>Danny Ashcroft</h3>

<p>The narrator and archivist. Danny starts as a seventeen-year-old new miner in Grimethorpe, South Yorkshire, stepping into the pit just as the 1984 strike bites down and everything becomes political whether he wants it to or not. Torn between loyalty to the coalfields and the pull of music, he heads to London to join Alex, betting that songs can carry a truth that newspapers will not print. As frontman of Coalface and later Glass Saints, he grows from raw anger into a strategist, shaping the Five Fingerprints framework for protest: Noise, Base, Movement, Access, Disruption. He wears his father’s pit tally disc on a bootlace under his shirt, not as nostalgia, but as a weight that keeps him honest. In 2025 he is the custodian of the movement’s memory, finally opening his boxes of tapes and photographs when Keira turns up next door and refuses to accept that the official story is the only one that survives.</p>

<h3>Michelle “Shell” Walker</h3>

<p>The architect of infrastructure. A neighbour from Grimethorpe, older than Danny and protective in a way that never quite turns soft, Shell is the movement’s logistics and nerve system. She begins as a force in Women Against Pit Closures, then moves to London and helps build The Furnace into a working hub where protest, art, mutual aid and planning all sit in the same room without pretending to be separate. Shell makes phone trees, coach grids, legal briefings and defence packs, the unglamorous scaffolding that lets other people be brave without being crushed by paperwork and fear. Married young to Eddie and raising Lily and Lucas through the years when everything was tight and loud, she later returns to Grimethorpe with Ben, still organising, still refusing to let the country tidy the past into something harmless.</p>

<h3>Charlotte Haversham</h3>

<p>The bridge and witness. Charlotte is a freelance photographer and journalist, and also the daughter of Rupert Haversham, a Conservative MP, which gives her access that never feels clean and never comes without risk. She documents the human cost of policy with an eye that does not flinch, building her Finchley Faces series as a way of showing the betrayal inside “respectable” Britain, one portrait at a time. She is at her most dangerous when she simply keeps recording, collecting photographs and VHS evidence that can outlast a headline and complicate what the state tries to simplify. In later years she continues to work as a photographer, drawn to the people society prefers to crop out, and stubborn about leaving them fully in frame.</p>

<h3>Alex</h3>

<p>The creative catalyst. Danny’s friend from Doncaster, Alex is the lead guitarist and co-founder of Coalface and Glass Saints, and the one who insists that the music has to be more than a slogan with distortion on it. Where Danny is drawn to organisation and message, Alex pushes for melody, restraint when it matters, and craft that can travel into homes that would never attend a rally. They argue, often, because Alex believes art works slowly and Danny is living in an emergency, but Alex’s insistence on making the sound listenable is part of how the work reaches beyond the converted, including through a John Peel session that cracks the underground open for them. Later, he turns his restless skills toward preservation, learning how to keep fragile recordings and stories alive when formats, fashions, and institutions move on.</p>

<h3>Riz</h3>

<p>The communications expert. Riz is the movement’s media and systems mind, running zines, pirate radio, mapping routes and moods, and translating messy reality into something you can actually organise with. He is fiercely protective of working-class independence and sharply allergic to cosy alliances with “posh” spaces that want the aesthetics of resistance without the consequences. He pushes the collective toward structured information, towards documents that can be copied, shared, and used, and later toward digital methods that do not depend on anyone else’s permission. In 2025 he is still mentoring, still teaching younger organisers how to survive, communicate, and keep their own records.</p>

<h3>Ben</h3>

<p>The steady hand. A carpenter brought in to build the stage and mezzanine at The Furnace, Ben stays because the place needs people who show up even when nobody is clapping. Quiet, skilled, and stubbornly practical, he becomes a core part of the collective and Shell’s partner when she returns to Grimethorpe. In 2025 he is still there, kettle on, workshop open, making space for the next generation to gather without having to justify why.</p>

<h3>Bill and Victoria Ashcroft</h3>

<p>The roots of resistance. Danny’s parents embody the coalfields’ lived reality, including the strain that never makes it into the speeches. Bill is a veteran miner whose battered dignity shapes Danny’s sense of what matters, and what cannot be faked. Victoria begins as someone who has learned to keep her head down, then finds her voice through the strike years, becoming one of the people who can speak plainly in a room full of men and be heard. Together they teach Danny that nothing is isolated, that every small injustice stacks, and that memory is work.</p>

<h3>Pete and Tommy</h3>

<p>The rhythm section. Pete and Tommy are the backbone of Coalface and Glass Saints. Pete is careful, precise, and obsessed with low end that hits like a verdict, the kind of bassist who can steady chaos without announcing that he’s doing it. Tommy is all force and motion, playing hard enough to shake the walls of a bedsit and still turning up the next day to do the graft that makes a scene function. In the decades after, they keep using their technical skills to help other people’s stories get heard and kept.</p>

<h3>Mickey (Mick)</h3>

<p>The next generation. Mickey starts as a kid from the estate who wanders into The Furnace during construction and becomes useful before anyone realises he is being trained. He learns stewardship, crowd work, and the quiet discipline of evidence, logging VHS timecodes and dubbing tapes so the truth can travel faster than the official version. He is Disruption in its least glamorous form, repetition, indexing, copying, persistence.</p>

<h3>Keira (2025)</h3>

<p>The new witness. A journalism student and Danny’s neighbour in 2025, Keira is the catalyst that makes the archive open instead of mouldering in boxes. She pushes Danny to name what happened, to digitise what can be digitised, and to accept that history does not preserve itself simply because it deserves to. By recording the Fingerprints and forcing the material into the present tense, she helps ensure the past remains usable, not just commemorated.</p>

<h3>The legacy of the Fingerprints</h3>

<p>The five Fingerprints are: Noise, Base, Movement, Access, and Disruption.</p>

<p>Together they function like different parts of a single hand. Danny carries Noise, the voice that refuses to soften itself into acceptability. Shell is Base, the grip that turns belief into logistics. Riz is Movement, the reach and routing that makes people and information travel. Charlotte is Access, the eye and the proof that can cross boundaries without lying. Disruption is what happens when all of that stacks and repeats, sometimes loud, sometimes administrative, sometimes nothing more dramatic than time, paperwork, and evidence being used against the people who assumed they owned them.</p>
